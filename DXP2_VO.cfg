5000253	I stand ready.
5000254	I thirst.
5000255	I thirst for violence.
5000256	I long to shed blood.
5000257	There is much terror to bring.

5000272	*That* is all there is to fight?
5000280	Die!
5000281	They must die.
5000282	Kill!
5000283	Kill! Kill!
5000284	Maim! Torture! Kill!
5000291	By the master's will.

5000320	<testily> Yes! Yes! I will go.
5000321	What now?
5000322	I am ready for victims.
5000323	Flying puts me in the mood for torture.
5000324	<evil cackle 2>
5000325	<testily> I'm going!
5000326	In good time!
5000327	Pain is pleasure.
5000328	I love to watch them squirm.
5000329	Their cries are *music*.
5000330	I will drink their souls.
5000331	<evil cackle 1>
5000332	Pain!
5000333	Agony -- my art form.
5000334	The sweet sound of suffering!
5000335	I feast on misery.
5000336	The nature of a man, eh?
5000337	No pain is unknown to me.
5000338	I long to *experiment*.
5000339	I am here. Where are my victims?
5000340	Here we go! <little laugh>
5000341	I'll show you *suffering*!
5000342	<sound like the haemonculus muttering a magic spell>
5000343	<shorter version of the same>
5000344	Souls!
5000345	Sweet, sweet souls.
5000346	Collect... the souls of the dying.
5000347	Fresh from their shattered corpses!
5000348	<feral scream 1>
5000349	<feral scream 2>
5000350	Die!
5000351	Cower!
5000352	Cower! Tremble!
5000353	They die. Now!
5000354	Claw out their eyes!
5000355	Limb from limb!
5000356	Take this point. Now!
5000357	The banner. Raise the banner.
5000358	<sounds of hissing or snarl, followed by the zap of an electric bolt>
5000359	Blood!
5000360	Cry. Cry out.
5000361	Aaar!
5000362	Dieeee!

5000373	<hissing> We're off.
5000374	On foot again.
5000375	<terror> They see us!
5000376	To the shadows! Flee!
5000377	Back! Get back!
5000378	We are hidden once more.
5000379	Time to kill again.
5000380	Let us return to killing.
5000381	Bloody murder.
5000382	Move in shadows.
5000383	Strike unseen.
5000384	We are Death Unseen.
5000385	Skin them, gut them!
5000386	Carve them.
5000387	We will feast on their beating hearts.
5000388	<hissss>
5000389	Yess?
5000390	What? Where?
5000391	We fear *nothing*.
5000392	We are of the shadows.
5000393	We are your nightmare.
5000394	They cower. We carve!
5000395	By the time they scream -- it's too late.
5000396	It is taken.
5000397	We have it!
5000398	It is ourssss!
5000399	We *lurk* in shadow. We wait to kill.
5000400	Them? No problem.

5000424	Pull back! Pull back!
5000425	<banking or swooping on his board> Hyuuuh!
5000426	In formation, ready to strike!
5000427	Let us fly again!
5000428	<screech>Hiiiii!
5000429	<slighly deranged> Faster. *Faster*!
5000430	Death from aboooove!
5000431	Speeeeeed!
5000432	Speed. Speed and death!
5000433	Skyboards -- dispatch!
5000434	We are on our way.
5000435	En route!
5000436	We live for the thrill.
5000437	We are fanged lightning.
5000438	Speed, bringer of death!
5000439	<brag> I can go faster.
5000440	Skyboards ready!
5000441	Flight and mayhem!
5000442	The point is ours!
5000443	The flag is lifted. It is ours.
5000444	It is ours, now!
5000445	We are Hellions -- lords of flying death!
5000446	They don't have long to live.
5000447	The killing game begins.
5000448	They lack skill; they are unworthy.
5000449	<smiling>We will carve them open.
5000450	These foes are clumsy.
5000451	I have faced worse.
5000452	We claim it as *ours*.
5000453	Raise the banner -- declare our greatness.
5000454	<sounds of high-tech injection>
5000455	<injection sound (shorter), plus an "aaah" from a wych>
5000456	Horrorfex…
5000457	Horrorfex!
5000458	I am your doom. Fear me!
5000459	Die a bloody death!
5000460	Your death is inevitable.
5000461	Say farewell to life.
5000471	We board.
5000472	Speed us to the battle.
5000473	We have landed.
5000474	Where to next?
5000475	They -- they are more than I can fight!
5000476	I must find firmer ground. 
5000477	It is -- not strategic to remain here.
5000478	Wyches, ready once again.
5000479	Ready to fight once more.
5000480	Shall we return to the sport?
5000481	For this I am trained.
5000482	I long to deal death.
5000483	This is *nothing* to my training.
5000484	I long for battle.
5000485	Their deaths are my art.
5000486	I kill for the prize.
5000487	I yearn to shed warm sweet blood.
5000488	Who shall taste my trident?
5000489	I have killed many.
5000490	Show me a worthy foe.
5000491	It recalls my days in the arena.
5000492	None have grace so deadly.
5000493	My skill is peerless.
5000494	I am dancing death.
5000495	My sparring partners never last long.
5000496	To the victor goes the spoils.
5000497	This location belongs to *us*.
5000498	Years of combat have prepared us for this day.
5000499	We are Wyches, killers tried and true.
5000500	Heel!
5000501	Heel, curs!
5000502	I will calm these savage beasts.
5000503	*I* command here. Come back to *me*.
5000504	Sic! Sic!
5000505	Get them!
5000506	Go my beasts, go!
5000507	Tear. Them. To pieces.
5000508	Tear them! Shred them! <laughs>
5000509	Go for their throats!
5000510	Strike terror in their hearts!
5000511	Savage beasts, do your worst.
5000516	Heel, curs! Your mistress is here.
5000517	The beasts will follow *me*.
5000518	Come, my pets. I'll find you something to eat.
5000519	Lay waste to the enemy.
5000520	Fear us. 
5000521	We heed the call to battle.
5000522	We will join in the bloodshed.
5000523	Plant the flag, a single bloodstained wing.
5000524	Plant the flag.
5000525	Let us claim this place.
5000526	To the air, my brothers.
5000527	Take to the air!
5000528	Skyward!
5000529	Rise, brothers. Blot out the sun.
5000530	*I* am the last thing they will see.
5000531	Death only after great pain.
5000532	Feel my blade!
5000533	Spill their insides on the ground.
5000534	The blood shall flow!
5000535	Teach them fear!
5000536	Fire!
5000537	You cannot flee us.
5000538	You cannot flee us.
5000539	*I* am the last thing they will see.
5000540	Fire! Now!
5000549	We fly... on borrowed wings.
5000550	Our own wings will take us from here.
5000551	Take to the air!
5000552	Take wing!
5000553	Our numbers are too few!
5000554	I - I cannot die today.
5000555	I *shall* not die this day!
5000556	We fly again.
5000557	Return us to the field of battle.
5000558	The deed is done.
5000559	It is done.
5000560	Upon the wind.
5000561	We soar on loathsome wings.
5000562	We hunger to make mayhem.
5000563	We shall be the dark wings of discord.
5000564	The sound of wings... signal your demise.
5000565	We rise in number. We blot out the sun.
5000566	The wind moans of vile deeds.
5000567	The earth does not deserve to touch my feet.
5000568	I have soared above Comorragh, and seen *such* things.
5000569	Our flag flies proudly here.
5000570	The flag flies, it is ours.
5000571	This place is ours now.
5000572	*We* are birds of prey.
5000573	We are Scourges; dark vultures of the battlefield.
5000574	They strike at us!
5000575	<a ltitle surprised> Here is bloodshed!
5000576	We are surrounded.
5000577	We are being attacked.
5000578	First to the fight!
5000579	I am a blur of death.
5000580	Slice through their ranks!
5000581	My craft will dance like a Wych's blade.
5000582	Full speed.
5000583	Swift beyond compare.
5000584	Going!
5000585	They cannot touch me.
5000586	My engine will scorch their broken corpses.
5000587	My engine roars -- I am but a speck in the distance.
5000588	Engine's running!
5000589	Reaver Jetbike: fastest instrument of pain.
5000590	Nothing can outrun *me*!
5000591	Reaver Jetbike!
5000592	My Reaver Jetbike is pure pain -- and pure speed.
5000593	We stalk -- we pounce.
5000594	The battle ends here.
5000595	We sow the seeds of terror.
5000596	We ride!
5000597	Commence assault!
5000598	To the battle!
5000599	Board now, or stay on foot.
5000600	Engines, full blast!
5000601	I have coursed the skies of Commorragh.
5000602	At the ready!
5000603	Is it time to loot and kill?
5000604	The engine screams.
5000605	Our weapons are terror, darklances, and speed.
5000607	<"hyaaaa" sort of whoop>
5000608	Raider craft, ready to loot, pillage, and kill.
5000609	Let loose upon them!
5000610	Unleash our might!
5000611	Know the singe of darklance blast!
5000612	We fly.
5000613	We fly for the front.
5000614	Heavy armor, at great speed.
5000615	Like a hammer, fall!
5000616	Propulsion at maximum.
5000617	Fire when the enemy is in sight.
5000618	Ready!
5000619	Ravager stands ready!
5000620	Heavy armor, heavy lances!
5000621	They shall not pierce *this* hide!
5000622	Naught can withstand our blast.
5000623	*I* am a storm of agony and fear, hard upon you!
5000624	The Ravager in heavy armor clad…
5000625	The Ravager: all jagged metal, guns, and death!
5000626	The harvest begins.
5000627	I give the gift of pain!
5000628	The battlefield - my banquet!
5000629	They shall not go gently... or quickly.
5000630	I go.
5000631	I go. It had best be worth my while.
5000632	I am the blackest heart!
5000633	Come. Do my bidding, wretches.
5000634	A throne of death and havoc, I ride!
5000635	To know me, is to know utter terror.
5000636	What?
5000637	Do not waste my time.
5000638	I shall feast upon their very souls.
5000639	We shall brew a drink of pain and death.
5000640	My chariot, forged in the Dark City, built for death and pain.
5000641	All these souls shall be mine to drink.
5000642	Beg for mercy! *Not* that it will help you.
5000643	Lay down your lives, that my greatness may increase.
5000644	The seed is planted.
5000645	Never! Never! <sob> Okay.
5000646	<whimper> Yes.
5000647	It is done.
5000648	I will do it.
5000649	I-i-i-n *there*?
5000650	M-must I?
5000651	<sigh> Free!
5000652	I made it out -- alive!
5000653	The horror!
5000654	I go... I go...
5000655	Where?
5000656	Where? Oh.
5000657	I do your bidding.
5000658	I'll make you better.
5000659	Mmm?
5000660	<groan>
5000661	<whimper>
5000662	No! Not the whip!
5000663	I am ready.
5000664	They told me I would build things, and - and not be beaten all the time.
5000665	A *bigger* cage. I can't even see the bars.
5000666	Gather the souls. Gather the souls.
5000667	In you go!
5000668	Get *all* of them! 
5000669	Fear us.
5000670	Fear us. Tremble!
5000671	I hope they scream.
5000672	Make it a *slow* death.
5000673	They die this day.
5000674	
5000675	
5000676	Cower in fear.
5000677	Cower before us!
5000678	Hoist the flag of Commarragh!
5000679	For Comarragh!
5000680	Hoist the flag!
5000681	Raise our standard. Let it strike fear!
5000682	Blind them!
5000683	Terrorfex!
5000684	Yaaaugh!
5000685	The pain!
5000686	Pain -- good!
5000687	
5000688	
5000689	We board.
5000690	Now we rest, soon we fight!
5000691	We've landed.
5000692	Now, where do we strike?
5000693	We have disembarked.
5000694	I am slipping! 
5000695	So many! 
5000696	We were not prepared!
5000697	They bear down upon us!
5000698	We - we are losing ground!
5000699	We rally!
5000700	See what we are made of, fools!
5000701	Our footing is firm again!
5000702	We must fight! Death is too terrible.
5000703	We hunger!
5000704	We thirst!
5000705	We move with speed.
5000706	Swiftly!
5000707	With speed!
5000708	They shall cry in pain.
5000709	They shall rue the day.
5000710	We feed off their pain.
5000711	We feed off their fear.
5000712	Lead us to the fray.
5000713	What *will* you? 
5000714	To arms!
5000715	We stand ready.
5000716	We thirst for battle.
5000717	Yes?
5000718	What now?
5000719	We are ready.
5000720	Where shall we strike?
5000721	There is mischief to be done.
5000722	Our flag is raised high!
5000723	It is ours.
5000724	The Dark Eldar rule here.
5000725	We now hold this point.
5000726	The point is ours!
5000727	Warrior Squad, ready to kill.
5000728	The enemy is upon us!
5000729	We have lost the element of surprise.
5000730	*We* are being *shot*.
5000731	That shot *grazed* me! 
5000732	Eldar. Their heads will adorn my belt!
5000733	Our puerile cousins think to play at war.
5000734	Eldar? I shall *enjoy* killing them.
5000735	A family reunion. I *hate* family.
5000736	The foe approaches.
5000737	Make ready. The enemy comes.
5000738	The foe!
5000739	I see... victims!
5000740	Our enemy -- good!
5000749	Raven fly!
5000750	Raven kill!
5000751	Strike them!
5000752	Die! Die! Die! Die! DIE!
5000753	I go!
5000754	Where? Ah -- there!
5000755	Engines, full blast.
5000756	I have my orders.
5000757	The Raven soars... 
5000758	Aye?
5000759	Nevermore! 
5000760	What would you?
5000761	Raven airborne.
5000762	I am the Raven, airborne death.
5000763	Build protocol confirmed.
5000764	Instructions received
5000765	I am equipped for that.
5000766	To specification.
5000767	Your will be done.
5000768	Immediately.
5000769	If you will it.
5000770	The Machine Spirit sings in me.
5000771	I will make it whole.
5000772	I serve.
5000773	I submit.
5000774	Be it your will.
5000775	I humbly await orders.
5000776	I serve the Sisterhood.
5000777	Smite the enemy!
5000778	Strike them down!
5000779	We cannot afford mercy.
5000780	They have committed the ultimate heresy.
5000781	Part from me, Sisters.
5000782	Sisters, fight by my side.
5000783	I place my faith in the Emperor.
5000784	I will consent to board.
5000785	I have longed for action.
5000786	I have spent my time in prayer.
5000787	We go.
5000788	Come, my Sisters.
5000789	With my commendation.
5000790	We march to the hymns of the Ecclesiarchy.
5000791	It is a judgment.
5000792	Thou shalt not. *I* shall.
5000793	We command dread and awe.
5000794	Witchcraft, heresy, and mutation.
5000795	By the Emperor's light, I lead.
5000796	Emperor, grant ascension.
5000797	Holy martyrs, ascend!
5000798	Fallen Sisters, rise!
5000799	Martyrs, rise!
5000800	Abominable traitors!
5000801	Wretched heretics!
5000802	Chaos! I should have suspected.
5000803	The blasphemers shall meet only with unflinching justice.
5000804	A foul daemon. We must be strong.
5000805	Grant us strength against all daemons.
5000806	Spirits of noxious immateria, be gone from hence.
5000807	The Imperial Guard. Tainted heretics, most likely.
5000808	Imperial Guard? Surely they are guilty of thought in their hearts.
5000809	There is the foe. Soon, we will fight!
5000810	The enemy. They shall be purged.
5000811	So... our foes approach. They will burn, shortly.
5000812	Look, Sisters! The adversary comes. Be wary!
5000813	The enemy is close by, and does not surrender. Do they not know the Sisters Militant?
5000820	Destroy them utterly.
5000821	The heretics shall burn.
5000822	None shall pass unscathed.
5000823	Aliens and mutants. Exterminate!
5000824	Go from me, my child.
5000825	Come. Walk by my side.
5000826	I will board. 
5000827	And where are we bound?
5000828	Upon the ground at last.
5000829	We arrive, I see.
5000830	Ah, our destination.
5000831	I will see to that.
5000832	I will consider it.
5000833	The guilty shall not thrive.
5000834	Absolution -- in death.
5000835	We must cleanse all impurities.
5000836	What is it?
5000837	No one is above suspicion.
5000838	Without purity, we are lost.
5000839	From true doctrine, never waver.
5000840	Do not oppose the Emperor's will.
5000841	A plea of innocence is guilty of wasting my time.
5000842	I have come to pass judgment.
5000843	A purging is called for. *I* will see to it.
5000844	...and so as proclaimed and decreed by holy writ…
5000845	Be still, I command it.
5000846	Suffer not to move.
5000847	Our faith conquers all!
5000848	Take heart, Missionaries!
5000849	Pain brings faith... or death.
5000850	If I must die, I shall welcome death.
5000851	Emperor, grant us dominion of this place, in thy name...
5000852	We will take it, without fail.
5000853	We will secure it for the Emperor.
5000854	Emperor, speed my prayers to the Golden Throne…
5000855	Oh great and provident Emperor...
5000856	Oh Emperor, in thy name, I kneel and pray...
5000857	Be healed.
5000858	Servants of the Emperor, be healed.
5000859	Salve for thy wounds.
5000860	In the Emperor's name!
5000861	Purge them!
5000862	My zeal guide my hand!
5000863	Bless this transport, Emperor, and shield it...
5000864	A humble Missionary boards…
5000865	I have weathered the journey.
5000866	Missionary, reporting.
5000867	My end is near!
5000868	I am lost!
5000869	Is my time come?
5000870	Did my faith ever waiver?
5000871	I must turn and face the foe.
5000872	No, it is better to die than lose heart.
5000873	Blessed be.
5000874	Onward!
5000875	Clear of sight, bright of heart.
5000876	We bear the Emperor's light!
5000877	Emperor, strengthen my resolve.
5000878	Let me be a beacon to the lost!
5000879	I remain pure.
5000880	Emperor, inspire me.
5000881	I am consecrated to the Imperium.
5000882	I am a servant to the Emperor.
5000883	…sworn ever to your service, when at peace and when at war...
5000884	From the lighting and the tempest, Emperor, deliver us. 
5000885	Location secured and sanctified.
5000886	I have made it holy ground.
5000887	Praised be the Emperor, for giving us this point...
5000888	A humble Missionary, here to serve!
5000889	I am come, with the Emperor's Creed in hand.
5000890	Show no mercy!
5000891	No pity for the foe!
5000892	Death to the impure!
5000893	In His name, we bring fiery retribution.
5000894	Sisters, aim true.
5000895	Claim that point!
5000896	Claim it for the Emperor.
5000897	It will be ours.
5000898	We have our target.
5000899	Phosphor grenades!
5000900	Throw the grenade!
5000902	Feel our wrath!
5000903	Strike them, Sisters!
5000904	Strike them down!
5000905	Fear the Sisters of Battle!
5000906	I am hit!
5000907	I am wounded!
5000908	Emperor preserve us.
5000909	We will go obediently. 
5000910	We tread the path of righteousness.
5000911	The Emperor has preserved us.
5000912	We have arrived. Where is the fight?
5000913	Emperor, do not forsake me!
5000914	We are overcome!
5000915	They are too many!
5000916	Retreat!
5000917	Retreat, Sisters!
5000918	Our faith is bolstered.
5000919	We're ready to fight.
5000920	Sisters ready for battle.
5000921	We have regained our footing.
5000922	We will be martyrs.
5000923	Have no pity.
5000924	We shall deliver.
5000925	Praise the Emperor!
5000926	We walk in his light.
5000927	Our faith is unyielding.
5000928	Our burning ferver guides us.
5000929	Daughters of the Emperor, march!
5000930	Sisters march!
5000931	We know our place.
5000932	Our Emperor gives us strength.
5000933	They walk in darkness.
5000934	They will never triumph.
5000935	Discipline and devotion never falter.
5000936	We are servants of the God-Emperor.
5000937	The Emperor: our father and guardian.
5000938	All but the faithful perish.
5000939	We claim it for the Imperium. 
5000940	Strategic point taken.
5000941	The point is ours.
5000942	Sisters of Battle, reporting.
5000943	Adepta Sororitas, prepared to serve.
5000944	We are taking fire.
5000945	<little more of a screech> Enemy fire!
5000946	Reinforcements! We require reinforcements!
5000947	We are under attack.
5000948	We are under attack. Do not lose heart!
5000949	Chaos! We must strengthen our resolve!
5000950	I see Chaos. The traitors must die!
5000951	The forces of a Chaos! We face a mighty test.
5000952	Daemons! Have faith, Sisters!
5000953	Look! A daemon!
5000954	Guardsmen! Faithless wretches.
5000955	The Imperial Guard. If they retreat, they have sinned against the Emperor.
5000956	Make ready for battle, Sisters!
5000957	The enemy draws nigh. Gather your strength!
5000958	The battle will soon be joined!
5000959	Sisters, we have sighted the enemy.
5000960	Our foes approach. Prepare yourselves.
5000961	There! There is our enemy!
5000968	We fall upon the infidel!
5000969	Taste our wrath!
5000970	Our ferver shall make them tremble!
5000971	Heretic and alien, fear us.
5000972	We will take this ground.
5000973	We will make this place secure.
5000974	Seraphim, to the air!
5000975	Jump packs -- *now*!
5000976	To the air, Sisters!
5000977	…grant us flight, grant us safe landing…
5000978	Crush the enemy!
5000979	We are Seraphim!
5000980	Purge the tainted!
5000981	…and bless us with safe passage...
5000982	The Emperor has protected us...
5000983	We are outnumbered!
5000984	My courage wavers!
5000985	Emperor, come to my aid!
5000986	Prayer has bolstered my resolve.
5000987	Our morale is recovered.
5000988	Seraphim ready to fight again!
5000989	On the move.
5000990	The hymns of battle fill my ears.
5000991	It shall come to pass!
5000992	Seraphim, from on high!
5000993	Seraphim, march!
5000994	No obstacle can check us.
5000995	Seraphim Squad.
5000996	Battle Sisters, aerial assault.
5000997	It is the Emperor who grants us flight.
5000998	Without our faith, we would fall.
5000999	Without devotion, we are nothing.
5001000	Up high, I can hear the Emperor whisper.
5001001	We have laid claim to it.
5001002	We have made it secure.
5001003	Seraphim, aerial assault squad.
5001004	We are the wings of the Sisters of Battle.
5001005	Eviscerators primed.
5001006	Grant us absolution!
5001007	Sisters, atone through conquest.
5001008	Emperor, make me thine instrument.
5001009	Prepare it for the Sisterhood.
5001010	Make this ground ready.
5001011	Die!
5001012	Be cleansed!
5001013	You will perish!
5001014	Commit us unto this vessel.
5001015	Emperor, convey us in your light.
5001016	Let us begin to atone.
5001017	Repentia Squad, on the ground.
5001018	I am proved unworthy!
5001019	I have sinned too much!
5001020	*His* grace has comforted me.
5001021	No, I will atone for my sins.
5001022	We follow.
5001023	Show us the way.
5001024	Lead us to victory.
5001025	Emperor, guide us.
5001026	Swerve not from the path!
5001027	Purge! Repent!
5001028	The Emperor's grace... at all costs!
5001029	We are holy outcasts!
5001030	
5001031	No austerity too severe.
5001032	No trial too rigorous.
5001033	Few equal our resolve.
5001034	I seek grace in exile.
5001035	Strive ever for redemption.
5001036	To the Emperor, my life! To Him, my death!
5001037	We offer up these grounds -- to our Emperor.
5001038	This place has been consecrated.
5001039	*We* are the Sisters Repentia.
5001040	Repentia Squad, here to serve.
5001041	We pay our debt in blood.
5001042	They are marked.
5001043	They have not long to live.
5001044	They will never see me coming.
5001045	Swift death? Or slow death?
5001046	I walk in the ways of death.
5001047	
5001048	I go.
5001049	Death-Cult Assassin, reporting.
5001050	I am an assassin. I cannot fight an army!
5001051	I must flee!
5001052	I have found my footing.
5001053	I can now return to my sworn duty.
5001054	I go.
5001055	I go hence.
5001056	Quietly!
5001057	Name the victim.
5001058	I am death.
5001059	I am death, in every form.
5001060	Those that defy the Imperium, fear me!
5001061	What shall I kill?
5001062	The bitter kiss of poison.
5001063	Sworn to the secrets of the Death Cult.
5001064	Pledged to the Emperor's Creed.
5001065	I whisper to my blades, "Kill, kill."
5001066	The art of death is in my bones and blood.
5001067	All owe the Emperor a debt of blood.
5001068	Death-Cult Assassin, ready to kill.
5001069	I kill for the Emperor.
5001070	The unbelievers will *burn*!
5001071	Annihilate them all!
5001072	Strike down our foes!
5001073	It is now their time to die.
5001074	We purge with righteous zeal.
5001075	Death to the heretics!
5001076	Take the point!
5001077	It will be secured!
5001078	So that is our target.
5001079	Charge, Sisters!
5001080	Celestians, crush them!
5001081	I must learn... from the pain.
5001082	We board directly.
5001083	Celestians, boarding.
5001084	Do we fight now?
5001085	Enough with sitting still!
5001086	We are surrounded!
5001087	Pull back, Sisters!
5001088	Cover! Seek cover!
5001089	Our morale is recovered.
5001090	Let us fight again.
5001091	Now we can take them.
5001092	Never shall we tremble.
5001093	We know not fear.
5001094	We immolate all before us.
5001095	Emperor, be my light.
5001096	Foes and allies fear us alike.
5001097	Submit fully to the Emperor's will.
5001098	Many aspire -- few attain.
5001099	The best fulfill our ranks.
5001100	I serve the Emperor.
5001101	To the hymns of the Ecclesiarchy.
5001102	We have excelled at battle.
5001103	Point secured!
5001104	It is now consecrated ground.
5001105	We have taken the target.
5001106	Celestian Squad, ready for battle!
5001107	Many wars, have we served the Emperor.
5001108	My fury hath no bounds!
5001109	Emperor, let *my* hand take their lives!
5001110	They are consigned to certain death!
5001111	Foul apostasy, be stricken from this world!
5001112	I bring salvation... through annihilation.
5001113	Stand aside… or be felled.
5001114	Lay low the tainted and corrupt.
5001115	Tremble, all you flawed and mortal.
5001116	I am a vessel of the Emperor's wrath. 
5001117	I smite the terrors of darkness.
5001118	I am proof of the Emperor's might.
5001119	I shine with the purest of light.
5001120	It is I who pay the blood-debt of humankind.
5001121	Lift up the hearts of the righteous.
5001122	I died for the Emperor, and by his will, rose again.
5001123	Follow my light, Sisters. It is the beacon of Victory
5001124	By my light, we shall purge this wretched, tainted land!
5001125	Battle Sisters, follow me! We shall march to glorious victory!
5001126	Taste my storm bolter!
5001127	Bound for glory.
5001128	Orders received.
5001129	Rolling forward.
5001130	To the front.
5001131	Into battle.
5001132	Take heart, Sisters!
5001133	They won't pierce my armor.
5001134	Are all aboard?
5001135	Guide, guard, transport.
5001136	Rhino Personnel Carrier!
5001137	This is Rhino Transport, I have reached the battlefield.
5001138	This is Rhino Transport, reporting.
5001139	It all goes up in flames!
5001140	Reduce them to ash!
5001141	They shall burn! Burn!
5001142	Understood.
5001143	Forthwith.
5001144	Incinerate! Incinerate!
5001145	Burning, rolling death!
5001146	They cannot withstand us.
5001147	My flamers are not brighter than my zeal.
5001148	Behold, the Immolator!
5001149	Give me something to burn.
5001150	My flamers cleanse all taint.
5001151	Behold, the Immolator Tank -- burning glory!
5001152	Behold, the Immolator Tank -- purgation manifest!
5001153	Preparing to fire.
5001154	Proceeding to target.
5001155	We will annihilate them.
5001156	Proceeding.
5001157	Forward!
5001158	Directly.
5001159	We will blot out corruption.
5001160	Exorcist missiles... loaded!
5001161	The Emperor's fury moves among you.
5001162	Exorcist, ready.
5001163	What can I blast?
5001164	Can you hear the organs play?
5001165	The Sisterhood hath no fury... like the Exorcist Tank.
5001166	Exorcist Tank, symbol of the Emperor's might!
5001167	Fire!
5001168	Lightning striiikes!
5001169	Enemies targeted.
5001170	Engaging.
5001171	I'm there. <through a grin>
5001172	Let them try it.
5001173	You can't run from *me*!
5001174	Oh they'll have a dogfight.
5001175	Don't look for me -- I'll be gone.
5001176	Guide my throttle, Emperor. Let my aim be true...
5001177	Lightning here.
5001178	Faster than blasphemy. 
5001179	Lightning Fighter craft!
5001180	They *shall* not fly here.
5001181	These skies belong to the Emperor.
5001182	Lightning Fighter, defending the Emperor's skies.
5001183	Lightning Fighter -- true air superiority.
5001184	Souls, come here. 
5001185	Splinter rifle, sing!
5001186	Feed, my blade!
5001187	Beg for mercy!
5001188	Die!
5001189	Into the fray!
5001190	Fear us!
5001191	We should return, to gain a better vantage.
5001192	Ah! Where is our quarry? I long for the hunt!
5001193	I like it better when *I'm* shooting and *they're* dying.
5001194	By the Thirst! We are taking fire!
5001195	Know death!
5001196	With all due haste.
5001197	Death only after great pain.
5001198	Spill their insides on the ground.
5001199	The enemy is upon us.
5001200	We are being attacked.
5001201	<Greaaah!>
5001202	My turn!
5001203	Cut them open!
5001204	Into the fray!
5001205	Fear us!
5001206	Die!
5001207	Feel my blade!
5001208	I am a storm of agony and fear, hard upon you!
5001209	Into the darksome skies.
5001210	<machine hum sound>
5001211	I will strike you down!
5001212	No mercy!
5001213	Unbelievers - must - die!
5001214	<some grunts of exertion, not taking hits>
5001215	<some grunts of exertion, not taking hits>
5001216	<some grunts of exertion, not taking hits>
5001217	I will tread the path of righteousness, be it paved with broken glass.
5001218	Take *this*!
5001219	If you fall for the Emperor, he may lift you up.
5001220	Flames no brighter than my zeal.

5100000	During the Kaurava Conflict, the Imperial Guard were some of the hardest hit by Dark Eldar hit-and-run tactics. These raids, often small in size, came under the cover of darkness, and at lightning speed. Often, the Guardsmen on duty would not have returned a single shot before the Dark Eldar ships were speeding away, laden down with captives and other spoils.
5100001	The Dark Eldar penchant for speed, fear, and striking from the shadows served them poorly, however, when they found the 252nd Conservator Regiment pounding on their door, no amount of running or hiding could save them. The Imperial Guard swept over the Black Heart Kabal’s compound on the moon of Lacunae, crushing everything under its mighty, martial treads. 
5100002	The Imperial Guard soldiers were horrified at the tortured and mutilated comrades they saw there, and, when their victory was near, this was channeled into a vindictive rage which did not subside until the enemy’s buildings and vehicles were shattered, leveled, and then crushed into dust.
5100003	The Blood Ravens looked down on and despised the cowardly, skulking methods of warfare that the Dark Eldar employed. Still, these vile xenos posed a sufficient threat to the system, and had to be dealt with. It was time to give them a taste of their own tactics. The Space Marines struck their moon-base with force and the element of surprise, routing the Black Heart Kabal and rendering them a non-threat to Imperial forces.
5100004	Of the Space Marines recovered from the torture grounds and Slave Chambers, many had been so tortured or mutilated that they were no longer fit for service. Still, undergoing these privations was no dishonor in the eyes of their brother Space Marines, and they were sent out directly for medical treatment and Inquisitorial review.
5100005	What the Canoness Selena Agna found in the Dark Eldar moon-base confirmed every suspicion she had harbored regarding these debased aliens. Such a vile race must be cut out, like a tumor, wherever it manifested. It required all her faith to look upon the atrocities and depravities she found in that place, and not go mad.
5100006	The Chaotic powers that twisted the nature of the Dark Eldar made them remarkably strong, but not as strong as the Sisters of Battle, who smote, purged, and pulverized every vestige of taint they found on the moon of Lacunae. All that dark iniquity was consumed in flame, and the valiant Sisters of Battle did not rest until the ground beneath them was thoroughly cleansed and sanctified.
5100007	Chaos Lord Firaeveus Carron had grown weary of the pestilential nuisance of the Dark Eldar, and felt the time had come to crush them under the pitiless hammer of his Word Bearers’ Chaos Space Marines. 
5100008	Had the Dark Eldar refrained from conducting raids on their chaotic comrades, they might have prospered in safety upon Kaurava IV’s single moon. But alas, their time had come. The Archon Tahril’s band of pillagers were no match for a full army of Chaos Space Marines. Unable to hide or run in their own base-camp, the Dark Eldar fell before the invaders’ fire. 
5100009	The Dark Eldar who were not slaughtered or fled found themselves subject to their vanquishers’ cruel games. The heretic Chaos Space Marines made sport of their victims in the very cages and torture chambers, in which their own brethren had been made to suffer. A just reward indeed, from the evil to the depraved.
5100010	Since they had been aware of their presence in the Kaurava System, the Eldar had watched their debased kin with disdain and some fear. At last, the time came when the schism that had long ago divided the Dark and Craftworld Eldar resulted in direct conflict. Perhaps the Archon Tahril’s kind had grown weak, or complacent in the safety of their moon-base. Whatever the cause, they were unprepared for the force of the assault which Farseer Caerys led against them. 
5100011	With the cold inevitability of fate, the Eldar swept the Black Heart Kabal forces from the surface of the moon, along with all evidence of their depraved deeds. Caerys issued specific orders, however, to allow the small number of fleeing Dark Eldar to escape. It was her full intent that news should reach the Dark Eldar home city of Commorragh of her victory and their defeat.
5100012	By the time that Warboss Gorgutz’ avalanching Waaagh! reached Lacunae, there was little that the Dark Eldar could have done to defend themselves or escape with their lives. Thinking their moon-base safe from notice or harm, they had squandered any chance of rebuffing the Orks that they could possibly have gained.
5100013	Tahril’s humiliating defeat sent him, Asdrubael Vect, and sundry other Dark Eldar fleeing back into the Webway to their home city of Commorragh. Meanwhile, Gorgutz and his Ork mobs had invented a new sport, which involved putting Dark Eldar into their own cages, and seeing how far they could throw them in the moon’s reduced gravity. Several Nobz attempted to harness and tame the Warp Beasts they found, but without any luck. Gorgutz did not let his Orks linger for long, however. Ultimately, Lacunae was one in a line of provinces to be crushed by his unstoppable Waaagh! 
5100014	In a system slated to be annexed into the Tau Empire, there was no place for the barbaric piracy of the Dark Eldar. Until the time that they were prepared to attack, Commander Or’es’Ka was barely able to tolerate the savage raiding and dishonorable tactics of the Black Heart Kabal. Now their time had come.
5100015	With ordered effectiveness, the Tau were able to take the Dark Eldar off their guard, swiftly scattering their forces, and obliterating all that did not flee back into their Webway retreat, where the Tau could not follow.
5100016	‘It is unfathomable,’ Commander Or’es’Ka later wrote, ‘How this wanton and senseless people could bear any relation to the Craftworld Eldar, one of the only Powers in our galaxy who possess some hope of one day embracing the Greater Good.’
5100017	The battle between the Necrons and Dark Eldar armies, although both were undoubtedly evil, was in many ways a struggle of life versus death. For the Dark Eldar were devotees of life, feasting on its vibrancies and its excesses. The Necrons, for their part, stood only for death and cold, brute power. 
5100018	Unfortunately for the Dark Eldar, the weapons of horror and suffering were entirely lost on the unfeeling, metal-bodied Necron army. Indeed, where the Dark Eldar remained a small and agile force, the Necrons multiplied until they were a sea without number, an advantage which served them greatly in overwhelming the Dark Eldar stronghold.
5100019	As they killed each other on the field of battle, did either side remember that once, in a past age, they had also been mortal enemies at war? Perhaps this memory deepened the bitter despair of the Dark Eldar, as they fought and died. Perhaps there was a gloating air of vengeance to the Necrons as they crushed them.
5100020	The fact that an ancient Eldar stronghold had resided on Kaurava III took the 252nd Conservator Regiment entirely by surprise, something that General Vance Stubbs was not pleased to hear of. After sending the officers responsible for intelligence on Kaurava III to the firing squads, General Stubbs undertook to remove all non-Imperial presences from the planet.
5100021	Although the strategies and technology of the Eldar far outmatched his abilities, the fearless General marshaled firepower and heavy armor to great advantage, finally revealing, cornering, and removing  the Eldar forces from the face of the the map. 
5100022	What the Imperial Guard found, after the battle, was evidence of an Eldar military presence older than theirs, and, in fact, older than the very Imperium. General Stubbs paused only a moment to wonder at this, before ordering nearly all of the Eldar structures and artifacts summarily destroyed.
5100023	In Stubbs’ mind, Kaurava III was a waste planet, good for mining, a few necessary military installations, and no more. The Upper Wastes would make a finer low-grade outpost for the Imperial Guard.
5100024	Having been fully briefed on the recent Eldar interference on Lorn V and in the Conflict Over Kronus, Force Commander Indrick Boreale kept a wary eye on the armies of Farseer Caerys. Although he might have made a cautious ally of the stern Eldar leader in other circumstances, Boreale did not hesitate to attack her stronghold in the Upper Wastes when the opportunity presented itself, in order to ensure the Blood Ravens' complete subjugation of the Kaurava System.
5100025	Boreale knew that in a direct attack, he was facing a shrewd tactician whose instincts and battlefield wisdom might well exceed his own. Nevertheless, he had full faith in his Space Marines to overpower and outmaneuver the Eldar at every opportunity. The gamble paid off, and the Blood Ravens took the day.
5100026	The Space Marines found evidence suggesting an Eldar presence in the Upper Wastes that was surprisingly ancient. However, other than a small number of supply caches, the base consisted of very little, as the Eldar relied heavily on their Webway.
5100027	Canoness Selena Agna viewed the Eldar as she did every other alien race: as enemies of the God-Emperor. She knew of their ancient and advanced civilization, but to her this only made them rivals to the Emperor’s primacy. Bolstered by her adherence to the doctrine of the Ecclesiarchy, the Canoness marched against the Eldar, declaring them natural enemies of the Imperium. The many ruses and deceits of the alien enemy could not prevail against the Sisters of Battle religious zeal and devastating flames.
5100028	Following the victory, and the necessary prayers and ablutions, Canoness Agna ordered the ancient Eldar stronghold cleansed. Almost all the Eldar technology was burned and cleared away. The Upper Wastes were ritually purified and declared territory of the Imperium and dominion of the Ecclesiarchal Sisterhood.
5100029	Frustrated by their elusive tactics, Chaos Lord Firaeveus Carron felt a growing ire towards the Eldar. His longing to crush these troublesome foes, combined with his desire to claim the barren lands of the Upper Wastes for a great temple and testament to the powers of Chaos, ensured that the Word Bearers Legion would attack at their stronghold without great delay.
5100030	Soon Lord Carron could wait no longer, and his Chaos Space Marines struck with deadly might and fury. They thwarted the many tricks and traps that Farseer Caerys set, unleashing havoc in their wake. 
5100031	After the enemy was routed, and the Farseer had fled, Carron loosed his men to hunt and torture the remaining Eldar. Once nothing living was left, the Chaos Space Marines took to looting and destroying the Eldar structures and stores.
5100032	Eldar do not easily forget. The Dark branch of their kind, who many millennia ago had split from their Craftworld cousins, still looked back on them with the kind of hatred that can only stem from personal betrayal. Since they had arrived in the system, Archon Tahril had kept a wary eye on the doings of the Eldar Farseer. Debased by nature, he could not restrain himself for long against the provocations of this ancient hatred.
5100033	When he felt he was strong enough, he and his bloodthirsty raiding band fell upon the Eldar stronghold of Essel ir-Tanil, which the Imperium had named the Upper Wastes. Archon Tahril and Farseer Caerys were pitted one against the other, speed for speed, trick for trick, evasion for evasion, but in the end it was the Dark Eldar who struck the final blow. 
5100034	The wild pleasure that his warriors took in defiling the captured Eldar was far greater than it could have been for any other race. Of course, the bulk of hostages were reserved for tribute to Tahril and his superiors. Yet in spite of all his bounty, Tahril was deeply pained to learn that Farseer Caerys had escaped, and might never be made his personal plaything. Still, the victory was great, and would raise his standing among the Archons of the Black Heart Kabal.
5100035	If Warboss Gorgutz had learned anything in his many years leading the Orks, it’s that the Eldar, or “pointy-ears,” were trouble, and it was best to crush them as soon as you had the chance. When his Kauravan boyz found themselves in the hot, sandy barrens of the Upper Waste, he gave them a good talk, warning them that they’d have to be the sharpest-eyed, fastest, choppiest Orks ever known. 
5100036	While it might not be said that the Orks anticipated every move of the quick-witted and devious Eldar, they certainly proved that Orkish strength and resilience could stand up to any such trickiness. Pressed hard by the avalanche of Orks, the Eldar fought frantically, and then, overwhelmed, succumbed. 
5100037	The fact that some Eldar, including the Farseer Caerys, were able to retreat into their last Webway Gate before the advancing Orks, troubled Gorgutz very little. He had won. The Orks scoured the area, uncovered the many caches and depots hidden within the stronghold’s grounds, and smashed a great deal of it with triumphant enthusiasm.
5100038	Since arriving in the Kaurava System, the Tau Commander Or’es’Ka had watched the  Eldar forces closely. Puzzled by their presence, he had endeavored to grasp the nature of their interest in the conflict. Unfortunately, Or’es’Ka was unable to know the ancient feud between the Eldar and the Necrons, or interpret the actions of Farseer Caerys, who led not by strategy, in the Tau sense, but by powerful visions of future dangers. To him, the Eldar were on an inexplicable warpath. Although he could not reconcile this with past knowledge of the Eldar, he determined that their presence in Kaurava was incompatible with the Greater Good.
5100039	The hot, dry lands of the Upper Wastes were an advantage to Commander Or’es’Ka’s Fire Warriors. With their calm discipline and well-orchestrated tactics, they drove the Eldar from the field. Or’es’Ka ordered his warriors to allow fleeting Eldar to escape, but after the battle, the land was scoured for Webway gates, all of which were destroyed. The great commander hoped that in this fashion, the Eldar would hear of the Tau superiority and benevolence, and one day join them under the banner of the Greater Good. 
5100040	Many millennia ago, the Necrons and Eldar had waged epic war across the lands of Kaurava III, and in that distant age the Eldar had prevailed. Now it was as if that same battle replayed itself, but vanquisher and vanquished were reversed. All the deadly might of the Eldar art of war proved useless against the Necron onslaught. All the premonitions and provisions of Farseer Caerys failed to match her adversary, the Necron Lord. 
5100041	The other combatants in the Kaurava System had distracted the Eldar.  The Necrons grew strong, while the Eldar’s strength was whittled away.
5100042	The Necron Lord, or the dark gods he served, surely took some malevolent satisfaction in the victory over the Eldar stronghold. The Necron army did not stop at the slaughter of all life forms, but trampled every last vestige of the Eldar presence, uncovering many of their ancient supply caches in the process.
5100055	The vast Tau military complex on Kaurava II’s second moon had always been intended for purposes above and beyond the current war. In a Tau-dominated solar system, this complex would become a key outpost on the Empire’s border. This moon base had been named Nan Yanoi, or “Sword Moon”, referring to the powerful Ar’Ka Cannon built there. This weapon could fire its devastating ion beam on any territory of any planet in the system.
5100056	Heavy fortifications and anti-aircraft arrays were not enough for the Earth Caste architects of Nan Yanoi. To these they added an ambitious orbital perimeter defense system, which would fire ion beams, similar to that of the Ar’Ka Cannon, tuned to harm only intruders and spare Nan Yanoi’s infrastructure from any damage.
5100057	When complete, Nan Yanoi would be unassailable. Unfortunately, the Tau stronghold was attacked before it was complete. Many systems and fortifications were not yet fully operational, including the perimeter defense system. An invasion fleet could be shot down, but they could not as easily protect against a small force from making a beachhead at one of the gaps in the Tau’s outer defenses. Such a feat would be extraordinarily difficult, but it might just be possible.  
5100058	General Vance Stubbs’ heroic conquest of the Nan Yanoi moon base meant the end of any true Tau threat to the Kaurava System. In fact, the breach of their technologically advanced fortress and the death of their Ethereal rendered the Kaurava Conflict a bitter memory to the Tau. It would be centuries before the Tau would again consider any attempt to expand into Kaurava. 
5100059	Before the troops, General Stubbs showed disdain for the impressive Tau fortifications and battlements. Even if the outpost had sustained little damage in the assault, it would be unbecoming of pious servants of the Imperium to show too much interest in alien and heretical technology. 
5100060	More quietly, however, Stubbs had many Tau artifacts and weapons secreted to Segmentum Command, knowing well that he could curry favor among his superiors if their study should reveal new insights into Tau technology. While his men celebrated, looting and vandalizing the xeno stores, General Stubbs smiled to think of the progress he was making on an undeniably ambitious career path. 
5100061	To Commander Indrick Boreale’s company of intrepid Blood Ravens, the Nan Yanoi moon base‘s reliance on defense, unholy technology, and indirect fire were anathema to all they stood for. To defeat such an enemy was to prove, in Boreale’s mind, that the superiority of his men could conquer all. Of course, the Tau saw their defeat differently. The tragic loss of a revered Ethereal and famed Military Commander was interpreted, after the fact, as a failure to employ sufficiently rigorous methods.
5100062	Having little use for static defenses, Boreale left only enough men as were required to hold their conquest, no more.  The Commander thought that once he had claimed the Kaurava System for the Imperium, the moon would make a fine depot for the Adeptus Mechanicus. 
5100063	Of all their adversaries, Canoness Selena Agna felt that the Tau posed a singular threat. If allowed to complete their Nan Yanoi moon base, the Tau would have an almost impenetrable stronghold, which could do great damage to the Sisterhood’s cause.
5100064	Assuaging her fears, Confessor Treganum March counseled the Canoness to place her faith in the Emperor’s will. And, as it happened, the Sisters of Battle were granted the opportunity to attack the Tau before the moon base was complete. With much fire and many Acts of Faith, the alien compound was purged. Their commander and their false saint were slain. Canoness Agna took their skulls as offerings to the Emperor and tokens of her devotion. Some of the enemy’s heretical technology was sent to the Ordo Xenos for study, and much of the rest was dutifully destroyed.
5100065	The Tau were wholly unprepared for the fury with which the forces of Chaos assailed their moon base on Nan Yanoi. With no innate relation to the Warp, and no psykers at their command, the Tau could not anticipate the many augmented powers that made the Word Bearers Legion such fearsome adversaries.
5100066	The tortures and foul ceremonies performed upon the helpless Tau that were not fortunate enough to die in battle are beyond description. Within hours of the sack of Nan Yanoi, the base was covered in its defenders’ blood, and the carcass of their beloved Ethereal hoisted upon the barrel of the Ar’Ka Cannon, the one piece of the Tau base that Lord Carron did not see fit to desecrate.
5100067	Farseer Caerys saw with clear sight that her forces must strike the Tau moon base of Nan Yanoi soon, or not at all. When she arrived at the Kauravan moon, she realized how close this window had been to shutting. Had the Tau completed their advanced fortifications, their mighty base would have been nearly invincible. The Eldar must strike, and swiftly. Caerys trusted no other force to keep vigil over the ancient and deathless Necrons, and be watching still a millennium hence.
5100068	The dauntless Farseer had weighed the consequences of her actions carefully and many times since she had first foreseen the coming of the Kaurava Conflict. She knew that the Tau, though a young and foolish race, showed greater promise than the haughty Imperium, the mad legions of Chaos, or the dogged Orks. The Exarchs of Craftworld Biel-Tan had agreed that although brazenly striking the Tau might sever any non-hostile relations for some centuries, the Tau could not yet be trusted in any system so susceptible to Necron awakenings. Nevertheless, the bodies of Aun’Ro’Yr and Commander Or’es’Ka were returned to the Tau, along with all prisoners of war, as a token of respect.
5100069	The mighty if incomplete fortifications of the Nan Yanoi moon base had been constructed to withstand masses of invasion fleets and heavy weapons. In their many careful preparations, the Tau had not considered the sheer brutal speed of the Dark Eldar, perhaps because previous encounters with the Dark Eldar had not left survivors for the Tau to learn from. Regardless, the attack was so swift and so overwhelming that many Fire Warriors did not have time to arm themselves and die nobly in combat. They would, instead, come to find themselves in a hell beyond imagining, in the torture cells of Lacunae and Commorragh.
5100070	After the battle, Asdrubael Vect himself graced the scene of the conquered base, and presided over the vile banquet held on the night of the victory, personally feasting on the heart of the dying Ethereal. 
5100071	The Warlord Gorgutz took it as a personal affront that the Tau had chosen a base of operations on the moon directly above the Ork enclave in the Rokclaw Mountains of Kaurava II. More offensive still was the Ar’Ka Cannon, which exemplified the Tau principle of fighting from a safe and tactical distance. Of course, almost anything could offend Gorgutz, and he would have come to attack the Tau sooner or later, just because they were there.
5100072	Had Commander Or’es’Ka succeeded in finishing the defenses of his moon base fortress, the Orks might have beaten themselves bloody against its shielded outer walls. Unfortunately, the smallest breach in those walls was like a crack in a dam. Once through, the Orks closed the distance on the ranks of Fire Warriors and crushed them beneath their massive forms. While much was looted by the Ork hordes, Gorgutz claimed the Ar’Ka Cannon for himself, planning to use “da biggest a gunz” he had ever seen to aid his Waaagh! 
5100073	The brutality with which the masses of Necrons crushed the Nan Yanoi moon base was one of the bloodiest episodes of the Kaurava Conflict. It had been suggested that had the Tau completed their advanced defenses on the base, the Necrons would have been easily deflected. However, others contend that few walls have ever withstood the full force of a Necron onslaught. 
5100074	The sack of the moon base was a bitter lesson for the leaders of the Tau Military. They saw the death of a revered Ethereal and a noted Commander as a terrible failure to embody the philosophy of the Patient Hunter. It was haste and hubris, they reasoned, that had caused the ruin of their ambitions. The Necrons, meanwhile, with cold efficiency, had gathered the dying and captive Tau, Kroot, and Vespids. They were given to the Flayed Ones to practice their ghoulish art upon in preparation for the next battle. 
5100075	Little was ever uncovered and little will ever be known of how the Warp Storm was unleashed on the Kaurava System’s fourth habitable planet. Whether Guardsmen there grew corrupt and turned to evil worship, or whether the Storm took them unawares is an open question. What is without doubt is that at the Storm’s eye lay the lair of the Chaos Space Marines, and at the heart of this lair, a network of unholy and bloodstained shrines, linked somehow inextricably to the storm itself.
5100076	Although the lethal Warp Storm would flicker and squall here and there, ever shifting, a permanent conduit to the Warp was maintained between these shrines. A charged field of Immateria whirled there, certain death to any who had not given themselves over fully to Chaos. In that radiant, deadly energy field, strange shapes could be seen dancing, screaming, howling…
5100077	Any would-be conqueror of this unholy citadel would somehow have to dispel the Chaos field that protected it. To enter it would be certain death. And while it stood, nothing could reach the forces of Chaos that lurked at its center.
5100078	The Dark Eldar little feared an attack on their base of operations, situated as it was on the dark side of the moon well within the reaches of the Warp Storm of Kaurava IV. The seventh Ancient Gate lay on that moon, but the Dark Eldar, knowing its technology well, had fixed it to work only for them when they had arrived there.
5100079	The effect of this hubris, and the general anarchic nature of Archon Tahril’s soldiers, resulted in a sprawling makeshift reproduction of Commorragh, the Dark Eldar home city. Surrounding the major warcamp lay smaller camps, surrounded by miles of torture ground, a sort of cage-garden of the Haemonculus Grumenael’s making. Rich with plunder in slaves, scraps, and goods, this area had grown and sprawled. Meanwhile, the center grew dense with powerful Dark Eldar, and the legendary Asdrubael Vect, leader of Tahril’s Black Heart Kabal, was said to oversee the war preparations there.
5100080	To say that the Dark Eldar were unprepared for an attack would not be quite accurate. The Dark Eldar are ever ready for battle; it is a sport and a passion to their kind, and there is no such thing as catching them off their guard. Nonetheless, the miles of torture gardens were poorly attended at best, and full of prisoners, many still capable of turning against their captors. For an attacker there was a faint glimmer of hope… 
5100081	More than any other race, the Eldar concern themselves with the distant past and the distant future. In visions, Farseer Caerys anticipated the reawakening of their ancient foes, the Necrons, on Kaurava III. A Webway gate, unused for many millennia, flickered to life. In the blink of an eye, a barren tract of the wasteland planet became a sprawling base of operations, and the Eldar army poured forth from it. 
5100082	Just as quickly, this stronghold vanished from the naked eye, concealed by Eldar artifice. The Eldar had learned long ago that no bulwark, no matter how strong, could halt the slow, implacable progress of the Necrons. Only illusion, deceit, and misdirection could accomplish that goal – and these are things at which the Eldar are peerless. 
5100083	The Eldar had prepared a harrowing gauntlet for their invaders, with all the feints and deceptions they could muster. This stronghold was not just a foothold, not just a key strategic point, not just home to many Eldar secrets. No, through its long history, it had become sacred to the Craftworld Eldar, and they would defend it accordingly.
5100084	The Imperial Guard’s headquarters, in the Dussala Precinct of the city-planet of Kaurava I, was also the system’s primary Baneblade production facility. Under the strong and capable leadership of their new Governor-General, Vance Stubbs, the Guardsmen were once again well supplied, armed, and organized. Any attacker would find themselves facing a formidable amount of firepower.
5100085	Since the outbreak of the Warp Storm on Kaurava IV, the Imperial Guard had known a humbling series of setbacks – losing a full three quarters of their fighting men was just a start. General Stubbs was determined to triumph in the face of this and all other adversity. Unfortunately, a full regiment of Baneblade tanks, the Imperial Guard’s armored super-weapon, had that very day been dispatched to various territories throughout the Kaurava system.  
5100086	The Dussala Precinct headquarters was thus left without a single Baneblade to its advantage. But they had their factories. Repair parts, munitions, and operating crews were moved via a system of convoys to the centrally located Mars Pattern buildings which produced the tanks. These convoys, then, were to be the Imperial Guard’s weakest link and also their greatest hope.
5100087	The Blood Ravens had learned the value of speed and mobility through hard battlefield experience. Force Commander Boreale, who had studied under the famed Commander Angelos, sought to make his reliance on stationary, defensive structures as small as possible. 
5100088	Therefore, rather than build up the Space Marines’ central command, entire companies were reserved in the fleet above Kaurava II. These would be ready to deep strike with deadly speed into any territory, including the Blood Ravens’ own headquarters. If attacked by an enemy, drop pods would cover the Space Marines’ stronghold in a steely and thunderous hail, swarming the Space Marines’ enemies with super-soldiers and dreadnoughts.
5100089	Force Commander Boreale was sure of his plan. His greatest weapon was, after all, the superiority of the Space Marines themselves. Who could weather such a rapid and devastating defensive tactic? 
5100090	It was no secret that it was the Warboss Gorgutz himself who led the Waaagh! in the Kaurava Conflict. But who were the Orks he led? Imperial records indicate that these Orks had always been in Kaurava – going back at least a millennium. It seems that when Gorgutz arrived, they welcomed him as a long-awaited hero.
5100091	These rugged Kauravan Orks had sometimes overrun the system’s four planets, and sometimes been beaten back to their secret stronghold in the Rokclaw Mountains. There had never once been a successful attempt to breach the vast hideout there, and the Orks believed there never could be. But in the past these Orks had always retreated to this place in great numbers at the first sign of defeat. Gorgutz saw such behavior as un-Orky. He insisted that you had to take a bolter round or two if you wanted to win, and Gorgutz lived only to win. 
5100092	Gorgutz’ strategy meant that the Ork stronghold was not invincible, but this did not mean that it was undefended. Reaching the lair was one thing. Penetrating its defenses was entirely another. 
5100093	The Sisters of Battle rely greatly on their faith; it is their sustenance and their shield. When they first came to the tainted world of Kaurava, Confessor Treganum March was quick to see how much holy light – and fire – it would take to cleanse the four planets. He therefore brought the Living Saint Anais and placed her in their primary bastion in Sama, on Kaurava I. Following a secret and ancient practice, the Living Saint was imbued with the Inviolable Aura – an aura of invincibility which would prevent any chance, he thought, of defeat.
5100094	Guarded at the last by this Inviolable Aura, the Sisters of Battle marched with great surety. Who in truth would dare oppose them? What adversary could faith and fire not sweep from before them? In the face of Chaos and vile aliens, the Sisters of Battle merely redoubled their fervent prayers and penances, and fought on. They came to believe that glorious victory was the only outcome.
5100095	The idea that any would dare attack their mighty bastion was unthinkable. The possibility that their bastion could fall, beyond belief.
5100096	It may never be known what first awakened the cold legions of the Necron from their vast burial vaults in the southern coast of Kaurava III. Archives suggest that Imperial Guard survey crews may have been dispatched to Coastal Imossa several months before the conflict. Others point to the strange and unknown influence of the Warp Storm, which could somehow have roused the deathless Necrons from their slumber.
5100097	Out of the dry Imossan sands, an ancient complex emerged – part burial ground, part power plant, part staging ground. As builder scarabs removed sands and restored structures to power, its clean-cut, symmetrical, and lifeless form emerged. It pulsed with the green glow of the strange power which fuels the Necrons – vast reserves of it. Enough to drive an endless stream of monoliths and Necron soldiers.
5100098	Anyone foolish enough to assail this unearthed necropolis would do well to heed that flow of energy. It is the source of the Necrons' power, and if unchecked, there is little limit to what strength Necrons could marshal against their foes.
5100099	Had the 252nd Conservator Regiment, under its former commanders, ever taken their census and survey duties seriously, the ancient Necron stronghold on Kaurava III probably would have been awakened hundreds of years prior to the Kaurava Conflict. Whether their failure to keep any presence on this wasteland planet was remarkable luck or dismal negligence is now debated heavily by Imperial historians. 
5100100	Invigorated under the capable command of General Stubbs, the Imperial Guard showed their best face and everything that the ancient exhumed necropolis set against them was beaten back with ample munitions, perseverance, and heavy armor.
5100101	Adapting the example set in the War of Kronus, General Vance Stubbs had cargo-loads of bombs shipped to the Imossan plains, and every inch of possible Necron catacomb was subject to multiple detonations. Following the victory, Stubbs forbade any future Imperial surveys of Kaurava III. 
5100102	The famed soldiers of the Blood Ravens chapter were no strangers to the dread Necron legions. However, unlike the vast underground labyrinth they had fought on Kronus, the Space Marines here found a vast and terrible city, buried in the sands of the Imossan coast. Vast energy conduits pulsed beneath their feet, feeding power to a host of monoliths and a cold, lifeless army. Commander Boreale had been ready for all this. What he had not counted on was having to face a manifestation of the C’tan god, the Great Deceiver. But even this ancient menace could not keep the Blood Ravens from victory. Their deeds that day would be scribed and illuminated in the Imperium histories for perpetuity. 
5100103	Afterwards the Space Marines spent several days combing the sands of Imossa, destroying every last Necron, before leaving the area to special demolition crews. Taking a lesson from the Kronus War, every suspicious stretch of the coast was repeatedly detonated, to ensure against further Necron awakenings.
5100104	The Sisters of Battle, who piously hold all forms of alien life in disdain, treated the Necron threat with the greatest disgust possible. A Sister of Battle’s highest hope was martyrdom in her Emperor’s name.
5100105	Ultimately, this revulsion at the Necrons must have fueled the Sisters’ passion in the heat of battle, and brought them to their righteous victory. The sight of a Necron city, half-uncovered from beneath the Imossan sands, conjured for each and every Sister the enormous monstrosity of their foe. Defeat was unacceptable. Such a thing could not be permitted within the reach of the Imperium. The Sisters’ fury and their inspired Acts of Faith fully overwhelmed the Necrons. Even the manifestation of one of their C’tan gods, the Deceiver, could not salvage them from the purging fire that always goes before the triumphant Sisters of Battle, burning alien, heretic, and mutant alike.
5100106	In truth, the Necrons and the forces of Chaos have little in common other than their enemies. Where one is a cold and silent army of death and dominion, the other revels in wild noise, mutation, and action. When the Word Bearers Legion found themselves standing above the cold necropolis that had emerged from the Imossan sands, they saw not just a foe but the one thing, which, in their mad power and zeal, they feared and abhorred: subservience, silence, the void.
5100107	In the Battle of Imossa, the wild powers of the Chaos gods proved themselves in every way superior to the older C’tan gods of death – even when one of these gods, the great Deceiver, was summoned to fight in corporeal form against the Word Bearers Legion. By the time they were done, nothing was left of the ancient Necron city. All had been toppled, shattered, and smashed to dust.
5100109	It was the Necron threat that had originally brought the Biel-Tan Eldar to the Kaurava System. There could be no greater satisfaction to Farseer Caerys, than to lead her troops to victory against them, just as her ancestors had in an age long past. As her forces spread over the necropolis of Imossa, exterminating every last stray Necron warrior, she felt a great peace come over her soul. The future grew clear, and she foresaw the lifting of a great cloud from the place.
5100110	The glory and renown that Caerys’ forces had won that day was great indeed. The Necrons had been allowed to nearly complete the process of exhuming their city of death. They had even summoned a manifestation of the hated and reviled C’tan god, the Deceiver, to their aid, and all in vain. Truly, the battle this day was every bit as great as that of yore. And yet, she knew this enemy far too well. Her warriors would seal the many crypts, and afterwards bury the foul city in sands once again. But Caerys knew the Necrons could never permanently be defeated. A warlike vigil must be kept, and peace brought to bear at any cost, so that the deathless ones should sleep long and undisturbed. 
5100111	Although it was in a different age that they parted ways with their Craftworld relatives, the Dark Eldar had not forgotten the dark and bloody wars between their ancient kindred and the Necrons. The fiendish machines made poor victims of Dark Eldar piracy. They were always armed, and although their frames did encase souls, those were feeble and sour, and could not be tortured before reaping. Defeating the Necrons was a necessary and grim task. 
5100112	Although they took less joy in the endeavor, the Dark Eldar fought with no less ferocity. They danced and fired before their deathless foes with vicious abandon. The Necron legions could not stop them, and neither could the threat of the great monoliths. Not even the appearance of the Great Deceiver, summoned into corporeal form, could avert the Dark Eldar’s victory. Alas, no celebrations followed. They took no slaves and pillaged no goods. Their duty done, Tahril’s forces fled the place, in search of foes who could bleed, and plead, and cry out in pain.
5100113	As far as Warboss Gorgutz was concerned, the Necrons were no more than a vast army of little Meks. True enough, some of the boys seemed a bit unnerved by the dark metal battalions that massed like a lake at the base of the exhumed Necropolis on the Imossan coast. But Gorgutz simply made sure that they were more frightened by him, and they fought good enough. 
5100114	Although he’d had his doubts, the victory over the Necrons was as good a proof as any, in Gorgutz' eyes, that the Kauravan boys were worth their squigs. They'd had a tough time of it, descending into the bowl of death among the hot sands, but as Gorgutz figured these things, Orks were for fighting and there was nothing better than a good hard fight, so long as you won. Sure, that Deceivy Thing had come up and turned his boys' heads this way and that, but they beat it good in the end. 
5100115	The Tau Fire Caste believed that they had learned a great deal with regard to the Necrons in the War of Kronus. It was therefore with some dismay that Commander Or’es’Ka found the deathless and unreasoning foe headquartered in an entire city, half-exhumed from beneath the Imossan sands. His Fire Warriors had shown themselves capable of dispatching the slow-moving legions from a distance, but who could say what new forms of the enemy lurked in this strange necropolis?
5100116	A Fire Warrior, however, is trained from an early age to cleave to truth, to observe the greatest discipline, and to accept all threats with calm reserve. Even the ancient god, the Great Deceiver could not cause their rout. Indeed, the wise teachings of the Greater Good were tried and proved true on this day. Following the traditional victory ceremonies, Commander Or’es’Ka oversaw the careful destruction and sealing of the Necron city, before the sea of sand was returned to cover it.
5100117	There can be little doubt that the 252nd Conservator Regiment’s assault on the Chaos Space Marines was fueled by a sense of lost honor and credibility. While a final judgment could wait centuries in Segmentum’s martial courts, General Vance Stubbs knew well that the Warp Storm had erupted on the Imperial Guard’s watch, and that many suspected heresy among their ranks to be the cause.
5100118	Whether to make amends for their failures or to prove their detractors wrong, the brave men of the 252nd fell upon the enemy on Kaurava IV with all the force, armor, and firepower at their command. Under the rigorous command of their new general, the men became brave and resourceful. In such high spirits, and hoping that the defeat of Chaos would banish the Warp Storm with it, General Vance Stubbs declared it a day of celebration to be commemorated by all Imperial residents of Kaurava for ever afterward. Effigies in the Word Bearers Legion colors would be burned and Guardsmen paraded and honored, as was their due.
5100119	It is the wish of every Space Marine to seek revenge for the bloody wars of the Horus Heresy, when the loyal chapters battled the heretical traitors and earned themselves a place in the history of the Imperium. Force Commander Indrick Boreale knew well the fervor with which his men would fight, and strove to perfect his battlefield tactics, so he could grant them the victory and glory which was, he felt, their due.
5100120	Boreale’s company of Blood Ravens acquitted themselves more than admirably against the Word Bearers Legion. Although they waded through miles of corrupted land, into the very heart of the Warp Storm, where maddened cultists danced and chanted, and phantasmal horrors wafted through the air, not a single soldier swerved from his faith or duty. The Blood Ravens were proud soldiers that day, in the eyes of their commander, their order, and the entire Imperium. On that day, history was made, and they knew glory. 
5100121	The march into the black, corrupted heart of Chaos was truly a great test of faith for the Sisters of Battle. They walked among the many abominations born of the Warp, bearing witness to the desecrated forms of unfortunate Guardsmen, Sisters of Battle, and Space Marines, hung throughout the dark city as victory trophies. But still they marched, under the firm guidance of Canoness Selena Agna, purging everything in their path.
5100122	Ultimately, the unnatural powers of the Chaos Space Marines failed to unnerve or scatter the resolve of the Sisters of Battle, who took their foes with grit, steel, and a scourge of fire. The shrines were toppled and the other works of the Word Bearers Legion were scattered and smashed. Lord Carron and many of his soldiers were cast back into the Warp. Knowing the caution required when combating Chaos, Canoness Agna ordered much of the region quarantined and kept under remote surveillance. Though the battle was won, there could be no vigilance too great.
5100123	The Eldar generally prefer to arrange events so that the Imperium, and not themselves, are the ones fighting against Chaos. In the Kaurava Conflict, however, Farseer Caerys believed that the Chaos threat was too great for anything but a direct assault. The failure of the various Imperial forces to peacably cooperate was one ill omen. The eruption of the Warp Storm, and the speed and ferocity of the Word Bearers’ expansion was an even greater one.
5100124	The war between Eldar and the Chaos Space Marines was relentless and destructive, as both sides possessed and fought with powerful psychic abilities. The Word Bearers Legion had all the power of the Warp at hand to call upon, but despite this advantage, they were finally overcome by superior Eldar tactics, guided by the powers of Farseer Caerys. In this time of war, the Eldar quickly erected certain containment fields, to limit the dangers of the Warp Storm, and left the uncertain work of fully disabling it for some time after a hoped-for Eldar victory. 
5100125	When the Dark Eldar first arrived in the Kaurava System, they had been happy to conduct their raiding parties against the Word Bearers Legion as often as any of the other warring forces within their grasp. However, the Chaos Space Marines’ position directly below their moon-base stronghold was simply growing to be too great a threat. Archon Tahril took all but two leaders as fools in the Kaurava Conflict: Farseer Caerys and Lord Carron. These two alone might know where in the shadows to look for his fleets of Raiders and Ravagers.
5100126	As the Dark Eldar power grew great, Lord Tahril saw his chance, and decided to wipe the Word Bearers Legion from the system. With ruthless speed and efficiency, his savage forces descended upon the Peninsula of Iseult. The savageries and abominations of Chaos, rather than dismaying them, merely whetted their appetites for slaughter and mayhem. Although the Word Bearers Legion fought heroically, they were overwhelmed and outmaneuvered. The Black Heart Kabal raiders took Cultists and wounded Chaos Space Marines by the hundreds, dividing their spoils between tribute to their masters and a great feast of Souls to follow the victory.
5100127	When Warboss Gorgutz set his sights on Kaurava IV, he knew that sooner or later he would square off against the Word Bearers Legion. By and large, the great Ork did not pay much attention to the subtle differences between the different human armies. But he knew the Chaos Space Marines, under Chaos Lord Firaveus Carron, wielded great powers, and so was eager to test the strength of his Ork hordes against such a foe.
5100128	The greatest challenge for Gorgutz’ army was the unnerving face that the legions of Chaos present to their foes. What the Word Bearers Legion had in horror and the dark powers of Chaos, the Orks made up for in sheer numbers, size, and strength. When the battle was won, Gorgutz allowed the Kauravan boyz to loot their skull trophies, weapons, and other prizes, while a giant Waaagh! banner was planted where once a Chaos vortex had been.
5100130	Tau Commander Or’es’Ka had long watched the Chaos threat, and felt that the aggressive presence of the Word Bearers Legion could no longer be tolerated. The promise of Kaurava as a new and important Sept in the Tau Empire was too enticing to permit such a threat to remain. All the ordered military strength of the Tau was brought to bear on the Peninsula of Iseult. The Chaos Space Marines, though fearsome warriors, buckled beneath such a constant and unswerving assault.
5100131	Commander Or’es’Ka knew better than to try and take prisoners, or parlay at all with the survivors among the ranks of Chaos. Instead, his army removed itself for the powerful Ar’Ka Cannon to fire repeatedly on the defeated stronghold, until it was certain that no life could possibly remain there.
5100132	The ancient C’tan gods, who guide the actions of the Necron multitudes, look bitterly upon the Chaos gods as upstarts and rivals. The Necron troops marched in mindless ranks, overwhelming the Word Bearers Legion just as they would any other living opponent… and yet, there was almost a vindictive air to the thoroughness with which they slaughtered the vanquished soldiers of Chaos, smashing their shrines and laying waste to their buildings.
5100133	The Imperium, Eldar, and Tau looked on as one of the forces of evil was thoroughly annihilated. However, as formidable a threat as Lord Firaveus Carron and his Word Bearers’ Marines had been, their defeat was in no way encouraging. Could any living force halt the tidal wave of Necron death, as it crashed over the planets of the Kaurava System?
5100134	When Force Commander Boreale ordered his men to attack the Imperial Guard in the Dussala Precinct of Kaurava I, he knew full well what he was doing. There was no doubt in his mind that his actions were in the right. First, the 252nd Conservator Regiment was under great suspicion regarding their possible role in the Warp Storm’s outbreak. Second, by offering resistance to Commander Boreale and his Blood Ravens, it was the Imperial Guard that was defying proper authority.
5100135	Once the superior military tactics of the Blood Ravens had overwhelmed the 252nd Regiment and laid claim to their central command, the surviving Guardsmen were treated as fellow comrades-at-arms. Commander Boreale ordered them safely returned to Segmentum Command, where, unfortunately, few were likely to survive Inquisitional debriefing. Claiming the factories and munitions for their own, the Blood Ravens made ready to assume temporary stewardship of Kaurava’s four planets.
5100136	Canoness Selena Agna, from the very start of her campaign in the Kaurava Conflict, had harbored great suspicion towards the Imperial Guard, 252nd Conservator Regiment. Their presence in the system when the Warp Storm broke out was cause enough. But their stubborn – indeed, blasphemous – refusal to lay down arms and accede to the governance of her Sisters of Battle was the final proof.
5100137	For these reasons, the idea of making war on fellow Imperial soldiers did not trouble the Sisters. With steely conviction, purging flame, and heavy armor, the Sisters of Battle bore down on General Stubbs’ army until it broke and scattered. The evident cowardice of the Guardsmen confirmed every suspicion of guilt the Canoness had ever harbored. Her original resolve was then renewed and redoubled: every inch of the tainted system must be cleansed... cleansed by fire.
5100139	With their arrival in Kaurava IV, Lord Carron’s forces had wiped out, in a single blow, the 253rd and 254th Conservator Regiments of the Imperial Guard. Then, after crossing the entire system in a warpath of blazing conquest, they came to face the 252nd Regiment in their heavily defended city stronghold. The Word Bearers Legion no longer had the element of complete surprise – or the Warp Storm – to their advantage, but the result was the same: utter victory for Chaos.
5100140	The Word Bearers Legion considered this conquest a strike against the Imperium itself. Lord Carron let his Chaos Space Marines, Cultists, and other forces loose upon the city. The Guardsmen were rounded up. Those that did not turn over to Chaos immediately did so out of madness after a little torture, and very few died faithful to their False Emperor. Although Stubbs himself had somehow escaped, the broken bodies of his top officers were set up high upon a stage as a token and trophy of the day.
5100141	Farseer Caerys, upon arriving in the Kaurava System, was wary of the Imperial Guard presence there for several reasons. First, she could not have forgotten the treatment her predecessor, Farseer Taldeer, had received on Lorn V and Kronus by the leaders of the Imperium. Second, the likelihood was far too great that the Imperial Guard had a hand in the waking of the Necrons on Kaurava III, and possibly the Warp Storm on Kaurava IV, as well.
5100142	Soon the Farseer resolved to remove the 252nd Conservator Regiment from the Conflict. The Imperial Guard’s defensive position in the Dussala Precinct turned out to be extremely well defended, but General Stubbs’ men could not withstand the Eldar’s superior tactics and skill in battle, and, after a grueling struggle, were vanquished. In taking control of the region, the Eldar were able to re-purpose some of the manufacturing pipelines, greatly improving the ease of construction and deployment within the battle arena.
5100143	To the mind of Dark Eldar Archon Tahril, the Imperial Guard were a true conundrum. He thought of them as a burgeoning tree, hanging heavy with ripe fruit. And yet, the tree bore thorns, and the fruit was cased in hard shells. 
5100144	At last the Archon had been pricked one too many times by those thorns, and the time had come to take his blade to the tree’s trunk. The heavy armor and artillery of the Imperial Guard’s central command were aggravating to Tahril’s forces, but with terror, poison, and savage speed, they crushed the Imperial Guard regiment. The job was well done. With the tree felled, its fruit were all close to the ground and Tahril could gather them with ease. Some they feasted on and some they set aside for their masters. The Dark Eldar then turned their sights on victims with softer shells, and fewer thorns.
5100145	When Gorgutz’ Waaagh! came to Kaurava I, its strength and momentum had reached truly great proportions. For a brief moment, the thick, tiered defenses and heavy munitions of the Imperial Guard’s stronghold threatened to stall, or worse yet, break the Warlord’s Orkish avalanche. And although the pink-skins put up a good fight, and cost Gorgutz many an Ork, finally they were stomped flat. This was the first victory the old Kaurava Ork clans had ever achieved on the city-world of Kaurava I.
5100146	The great victory provided a huge morale boost to the entire Ork army, and many Waaagh! banners were spontaneously raised there, in Dussala and across all their Kauravan territories. But few Orks were happier than the Mek Boyz, who, in conquering the Imperial Guard’s stronghold, laid claim to a vast array of tanks, guns, and other spoils to be modified for Ork use. Gorgutz’ Meks even managed to turn some of the Imperium’s war factories to their use, promising readier and cheaper garrisons across Kaurava.
5100147	Although many armies now marched across the planets of the Kaurava System in hopes of dominance, the Imperial Guard had something the others did not. Their stewardship of the system for a millennium granted them organization and infrastructure which the Tau, who looked upon Kaurava as a future addition to their empire, could not help but admire. The Earth, Fire, and Water Castes were all in agreement, that the factories, maps, and communication pathways would reduce the colonization process by hundreds of years, if captured and repurposed.
5100148	Thus, it was as much for administrative as for military purposes that the Tau made war on the 252nd Conservator Regiment’s central command on Kaurava I. With calm efficiency, Commander Or’es’Ka’s forces pierced, overwhelmed, and routed the Imperial Guard. Once victory had been achieved, the Tau claimed the vast military-industrial complex for their own, taking those Guardsmen who would renounce Imperial allegiance under the safe wing of the Greater Good.
5100149	When the Necron legions arrived in Dussala Precinct, the Imperial Guard made every preparation to rebuff their advance. Unfortunately, few walls are thick enough, and few batteries of cannon are heavy enough to stop the Necrons, once they are moving in full force. Despite all the tanks, artillery, and tactics he could muster, General Stubbs was helpless against the deathless tide, and the Imperial Guard were overwhelmed.
5100150	The victory was not swift, but it was absolute. The day after the battle, not even the corpses of Guardsmen were to be found. Only a host of new Necron soldiers, and new monoliths where Imperial bunkers had formerly stood. The Necrons had even discovered the vast generators that had powered the many factories of the Dussala Precinct, and harnessed the energy for their own terrible purposes…
5100151	The fact that General Vance Stubbs was forced to attack the Space Marines directly was, to him, merely an unfortunate necessity of the war. Stubbs had every respect for Force Commander Boreale. After his Imperial Guard forces had outgunned and overpowered the Blood Ravens, he felt great regret that the Commander’s life could not have been spared. That of course, was impossible. No Force Commander would ever flee or surrender while his company fought and died.
5100152	The few Blood Raven Space Marines who had been unable to die honorably were given prompt medical treatment and dispatched to Segmentum Command. The dead were given all the honors and funeral rites due to their station. These proceedings, however, did not for an instant deter General Stubbs from installing a company of his Guardsmen in the Lands of Solitude, or laying claim to the useable munitions and other equipment left intact. 
5100153	The loss of good Imperial Space Marines was regrettable, General Stubbs reflected, but the charter of his regiment and his own personal ambitions had, after all, left him only one course of action.
5100154	Due to their long association with the Inquisition, the Sisters of Battle have often taken it upon themselves to determine corruption among the other branches of the Imperial armed forces. After witnessing the prevalence of Chaos in the Kaurava System, Confessor Treganum March advised Canoness Agna that any refusal to cede authority to the Sisterhood was clear evidence of heresy.  
5100155	When the Blood Ravens stood their ground, the Canoness acted quickly. Her mandate was clear: as heretics, they must be obliterated. Soldier for soldier, the Sisters of Battle could not compete with the Space Marines. Nevertheless, the Adepta Sororitas carried the day with their purging flames and Acts of Faith. Any survivors were shown the mercy of battlefield confession, which was far quicker and less painful than proper Inquisition proceedings. 
5100156	It was regrettable that so many Space Marines had to die. It was regrettable that they had come under suspicion of taint. But, whatever the circumstances, corruption must be fought and, at all costs, wiped out.
5100157	When Chaos Lord Firaeveus Carron set foot upon the outer edge of the Lands of Solitude, he could feel his greatest of victories fast approaching. Already, he had beaten the legendary Blood Ravens back to their very door, and left them cowering in their own stronghold. Emboldened by this turn of events, the Word Bearers Legion pressed on towards the headquarters of their ancient enemy, and there engaged in battle. 
5100158	If the Blood Ravens had not fought so well, Lord Carron would not so thoroughly have relished their defeat. His Word Bearers’ Chaos Space Marines, with Chaos coursing through their veins, with screams and great acts of barbarity, had countered the enemy at every turn, until victory was won.
5100159	Although the dead Space Marines were horribly desecrated in the aftermath, it was those who somehow survived that were truly to be pitied. The dying Commander Boreale was forced to watch many of these unspeakable atrocities before the last trickle of life drained from his body. Lord Carron dedicated the Lands of Solitude to Chaos, renaming the land in daemonic, Segraebbliut, but his men called the place another thing entirely: Ravensblood, for all that they had shed that day.
5100160	Farseer Caerys found herself more and more troubled by visions concerning the Space Marines. Should the Blood Ravens meet with success, several outcomes were possible, and too many involved devastating victories for either the Necrons or the rapacious Dark Eldar. Either through ignorance or provocation, the Space Marines would unleash horrible forces on the galaxy.
5100161	What the Eldar must do was clear enough, although a daunting task. Guided by her foresight and the wisdom of her ancestors, the Farseer led her army to the Lands of Solitude and there made a bold strike against the famed soldiers of the Imperium. She would, of course, have preferred less direct methods, but there was no other way. While the Eldar loss of life was terrible, they did succeed in subduing the Blood Ravens, and their duty was fulfilled.
5100162	While the battlefield was being cleared, and the Eldar dead ritually lamented, Farseer Caerys pondered her army’s next move, reflecting on the terrible price that is sometimes paid for peering into the tangled skein of the future.
5100163	There are few things the Dark Eldar fear, but many are the things they hate. In the eyes of the Archon Tahril, these Blood Raven Space Marines were a grand object of disgust. They stood for order, and the upstart human race, and, worst of all, claimed to be warriors second to none in the galaxy. To hate, the Archon added insult. The idea that any should be feared so much as his own Black Heart Kabal was a personal affront.
5100164	The time had come to prove his superiority, and punish the Blood Ravens for their offense – of existing. Tahril was greatly pleased when he vanquished the famed soldiers, but was even more elated at how worthy an adversary the Space Marines proved. One can weary of docile playthings, but no Dark Eldar ever feels so alive as the moment when one stands victorious, having narrowly skirted defeat and death.
5100165	The Archon considered it the greatest compliment to the slain Blood Raven commander, when he placed his severed, shrunken head on the upper tassle of his war-belt. The Battle of Solitude was a memory the Archon would cherish for many years to come.
5100166	Warboss Gorgutz had fought the Blood Ravens before, and he knew they were good enemies. Blink your eyes and they’d give you a good stomping. This time, though, he figured it was them that had blinked, and him and his boyz who would be doing the stomping. 
5100167	Still, when the Waaagh! reached the northern reaches of Kaurava II, those Blood Ravens put up a right good fight, and tore up plenty of Orks before Gorgutz closed in and squashed them good. Those boyz that made it took plenty of trophies in skulls, and the Meks got their green paws on plenty of the humans’ gear.
5100168	Those Orks that had shown the greatest bravery and skill that day were granted a true honor: promotion to Gorgutz’ elite personal guard.
5100169	As the Tau Commander Or’es’Ka plotted his careful strategy for the subjugation of the Kaurava System, he was troubled by the danger posed by the Blood Ravens. Their position on Kaurava II, too close to the Nan Yanoi moon-base for comfort, was only one of many reasons for his unease.
5100170	The time had come when Commander Or’es’Ka felt he must strike the Space Marines, or risk their strength growing to rival that of the Tau. As always, he found that the cautious deliberation with which he faced the challenge resulted in prosperity and success. The Blood Ravens fought remarkably well, but their defense was disorganized and inefficient. Taking advantage of this, Or’es’Ka’s forces pressed the Space Marines until they faced defeat.
5100171	In Commander Or’es’Ka’s address to his troops following the battle, he praised the Blood Ravens for their valor in combat, and concluded with the admonishment that, without the guidance of the Greater Good, surely it would have been the Tau who perished in defeat. 
5100172	In his last moments of life, Force Commander Boreale suddenly understood the full extent of his error. He had completely underestimated the threat of the Necron horde. With terrifying force they had poured across the borders of the Lands of Solitude, slaughtering all in their path. As the last flicker of consciousness was dissipating from his clouded eyes, the great Space Marine reviewed all that had passed, and saw that by the time his scouts had spied the Necrons through their scopes, his defeat was already inevitable.
5100173	The Space Marines must revise their protocols – Segmentum must be warned – and with that single thought, Boreale tried to rise. But the fingers of a cold lifeless hand were suddenly clamped around his arm. His soul had not yet left his body, and now it was destined for a more terrible fate than death. He would never join the God-Emperor.
5100174	The Kaurava System had known strife between the Orks and the Imperial Guard long before the present conflict, in the form of isolated outbreaks and outright war. But before this time, the Guardsmen had faced the Kauravan Orks alone, who were never as organized or aggressive as now, under the leadership of Warboss Gorgutz.
5100175	Unfortunately for the Orks, the Imperial Guard was also fighting under a new leader. The determined General Stubbs dogged Gorgutz right into the Rokclaw Mountains, farther than the Imperial Guard had ever penetrated, and there dealt his Waaagh! a mortal blow. While the Orks of Kaurava were thoroughly defeated, less is known concerning the great Ork Warboss himself.  Imperium scanner logs indicate that an Ork craft did take off from the scene, but any other information was lost to the heat of the battle. 
5100176	The Guardsmen of the 252nd Regiment who had fought in the Battle of Rokclaw took on the proud moniker of “Orksblooders,” and the mountain itself came to be known as Stubb’s Peak. 
5100177	In terms of fighting Orks, the Blood Ravens found as great a challenge in the Rokclaw Mountains as any they had ever faced. First was the difficulty in assailing the mountain stronghold itself. Second were the tactics of the infamous Warboss Gorgutz, whose prowess grew greater with every campaign he fought and survived.
5100178	As great as the challenge was, the Blood Ravens proved themselves matchless soldiers, undaunted by any foe. After overcoming the Ork hordes and laying waste to their ancient enclave, the Space Marines proceeded to hunt down every last Ork they could find in those mountains. 
5100179	There was only one blemish in the Space Marines’ otherwise flawless execution: Gorgutz himself somehow eluded their grasp. Some reports attested to a crude rocket, which took off at the battle’s end, while others claim the blast was a timed bomb, closing off a tunnel entrance to cover the great Ork’s escape.
5100180	The fact that the Imperium had shared a planetary system with the filthy Ork barbarians for hundreds of years, rather than promptly exterminating them, filled Canoness Selena Agna with disgust. Her Sisters would tolerate such an infestation no more than the taints of heresy or mutation. 
5100181	Of course, the failures of the weak Imperial Guard had become compounded. The Orks had been allowed to enter the dangerous “Waaagh!” phase, and could no longer be ignored. Cleaving to their sense of duty, and with a great deal of purging fire, the Sisters of Battle stormed the ancient Ork retreat in the Rokclaw mountains, and thoroughly routed their foes. 
5100182	The Canoness took her victory as a testament to their faith. When it was discovered, after the battle, that the Warboss Gorgutz had somehow escaped, she maintained that the Emperor had humbled them in their moment of victory, lest they grow too proud.  
5100183	Over the course of thousands of battles, the Chaos Lord Firaveus Carron had developed cruelly keen instincts. Carron felt that he must crush the Ork threat soon, or risk losing his foothold in the Kaurava System. He consulted his head Sorcerer, only to have his suspicions confirmed by a divination.
5100184	Gorged on bloodshed and strong with Chaos, the Word Bearers Legion crushed the Ork forces. They tore through the ancient Ork stronghold, an enclave untouched by intruders for millennia. While his crazed, victorious soldiers butchered and burned the vanquished army, Lord Carron stalked the grounds suspiciously, looking for Gorgutz, his nemesis. Again, his instincts had proved true: the great Ork was nowhere to be found. Still, the victory was won. No Orks would trouble the ascendancy of Chaos.
5100185	She had not been long in the Kaurava System before Farseer Caerys sensed the danger posed by an Ork Waaagh! there. But the time was not right, and so she waited, and watched. Lines and threats invisible to any ordinary tactician appeared to her, and then, at last, she knew she must move.
5100186	Although superior in number, strength, and barbarity, the Orks could not match the advanced strategies of the Eldar. Like a fine and deadly blade, Caerys’ forces pierced the heart of the ancient Ork stronghold. Their victory was unequivocal. 
5100187	Unfortunately, the Warboss Gorgutz somehow eluded the Eldar force. All the same, his role in this war was ended, and that was victory enough.
5100188	The bumbling forays of the Ork armies had irritated Archon Tahril one too many times, and he grew weary of their presence in his battlefield. It was without much difficulty that the Dark Eldar, keen of eye and ear, found the supposedly secret mountain fortress of the Kauravan Orks. The sheer number of these green brutes rendered the stronghold’s sack quite difficult, but Tahril prevailed.
5100189	Many Ork corpses festooned Raider and Ravager decks. Orks in great number were taken as playthings for Tahril, his Haemonculus Gruemenael, and as tribute to the elders of Commorragh. Hellions and Reavers were sent through the narrow mountain passes, to hunt Orks that had fled. 
5100190	During all these proceedings, Lord Tahril himself scoured the camp for his adversary, Gorgutz – but in vain. The Archon had looked forward with great pleasure to personally eviscerating the Ork Warboss. Still, they had sent him scurrying in fear, and that would surely suffice for now.
5100191	Commander Or’es’Ka had personally seen several engagements with the Orks, and considered them entirely beyond hope of reform. So, when the Tau learned the location of the Ork stronghold, directly beneath the Nan Yanoi moon-base, it was only a matter of time before they would need to be eliminated. 
5100192	Although no match for the Orks in close combat or in numbers, the strategies and weaponry of the Tau allowed them to achieve complete victory. The ancient mountain base, which had never before known a successful assault, was split open under the vice-like pressure of the Tau military. 
5100193	The Tau did not hesitate to claim the remote mountain enclave for their own. Teams of Fire Warriors and Kroot scoured the mountains for Orks who had fled, while survey teams mapped the terrain. It was only after a thorough analysis of the battle that Or’es’Ka realized that somehow the Ork Warlord, Gorgutz, had escaped. Still, there was little doubt that he would not be waging war in Kaurava any time soon.
5100194	Under the Waaagh! banner of Warboss Gorgutz ‘Eadhunter, the Orks of Kaurava had proved themselves tough, capable warriors. Their numbers, brute strength, and tenacity could not be overestimated. Neither Gorgutz nor his army, however, was prepared for the deathless legions of the Necrons. 
5100195	Undaunted by the fearsome reputation of the Orks, the Necrons shadow swept in on the Rokclaw Mountains. They coursed through the mountain paths and poured into the ancient stronghold, sacred to the Kauravan Orks, which had never before known intruders. Although the Orks fought bravely, and many who died that day should have been sung heroes, all fell, crushed beneath the flood.
5100196	This decisive battle spelled the end of the Kauravan Orks. The Necron methodically hunted every last Ork down. Strangely, several reports suggest that an Ork rocket blasted off from the Rokclaw Mountains just at the moment of the Necron victory.  Still, even if Gorgutz were aboard this rocket, and made it to safety, the Kauravan cause was lost for the Orks.
5100197	When the Sisters of Battle arrived in the Kaurava System, General Stubbs knew there was only one way he and his Guardsmen would make it through alive. No victory or act of penitence could clear them from suspicion, by the reckoning of those Ecclesiarchal zealots. Knowing that he had done no wrong, and unwilling to submit to Inquisitorial reconditioning, the General prepared for battle.
5100198	At first, Stubbs had hoped that the enemies of the Imperium would spare him the unwelcome task of pitting his men against the feared and dreaded Sisters of Battle. Unfortunately, Stubbs did not feel he had the luxury of waiting for mutual enemies to do his dirty work. He resolved on a bold and desperate move: to attack the Sisters of Battle headquarters directly, before they could come to him. With the advantage of surprise on their side, the 252nd Regiment, although weak of will and faith, showed themselves stronger in arms and armor than the pious Sisters of Battle. 
5100199	This extraordinary feat surprised even General Stubbs, and, on congratulating his troops afterwards, he remarked that it was certain proof that the Emperor had willed the Imperial Guard to hold dominion over the Kaurava System.
5100200	The charter of the Blood Ravens, 9th Company, in the Kaurava Conflict was undeniably clear: stabilize the system, defeat all forces of Chaos, and neutralize any opposing force. When the Sisters of Battle gave them direct opposition, it was necessary that they be removed from the stage of battle. 
5100201	The Sisters of Battle, of course, were also acting on their own orders, following similar instructions to brook no opposition. Evidently, there was not enough room for more than one Imperial force in the system. Unfortunately for the Sisters of the Order of the Emperor's Virgins, they were no match for the battle-hardened super-soldiers they were forced to fight. Although the Sisters of Battle defended themselves admirably, they were handily overcome. 
5100202	Once vanquished, the Space Marines treated the surviving Sisters of Battle with the utmost deference, giving them swift medical aid and providing them with passage back to the Convent Sanctorum on Ophelia VII.
5100203	Second only to the Space Marines, the Word Bearers Legion found a natural enemy in the Sisters of Battle. If anything, the Sisters Militant stood even closer to the false Emperor whose destruction the Chaos Space Marines were sworn to perpetrate. In the Order of the Emperor's Virgins the soldiers of Chaos saw more than revolting, pious zeal; they saw manifest evidence of the Emperor’s powers, through the many Sisters of Battle's many Acts of Faith.
5100204	Spurred by these considerations and the active threat the Sisters of Battle posed, Lord Carron resolved on a direct attack. He would prove, definitively, the superiority of the Chaos gods. The Word Bearers’ Chaos Space Marines certainly proved their own superiority that day, routing the Sisters of Battle and spurning their powers, prayers, and their Living Saint alike.
5100205	Of the dark ceremonies and horrible atrocities that the victorious soldiers of Chaos perpetrated there in the Sama District, it is not best to give a full account. Under the orders of Lord Carron himself, however, several particularly horrible examples were blasted into space, in a path that would surely be intercepted by an Imperial battle fleet.
5100206	The Eldar knew well that the Sisters Militant would endeavor to exterminate any army outside of the Imperium, and possibly any force within it. Farseer Caerys ordered the attack on the Sisters of Battle stronghold in the Sama District purely as a preventative measure. In the end, it was well that she acted when she did. The Battle Sisters proved formidable at their current strength. Any further delay could have resulted in disaster for the Eldar cause.
5100207	By defeating the Order of the Emperor's Virgins, the Eldar removed yet another obstacle from their path. The Imperium had squandered its claim on the region, allowing disaster to run rampant. It was high time that Kaurava saw wiser, more capable stewardship.
5100208	From the moment that Archon Tahril’s raiding force crossed into the Sama District, it was a contest of speed versus flame, of jagged and poisonous wickedness against stiff and narrow zeal. Unfortunately for the Sisters of Battle, the ruthless force with which the Dark Eldar struck them was simply too great. 
5100209	The marauders of the Black Heart Kabal were like a dark torrent crashing through the Imperial city, smashing the Sisterhood’s battlements. The Dark Eldar swooped down on many of the Sisters of Battle with such speed that they had not time to make martyrs of themselves; instead they would become the slaves and playthings of the debased Dark Eldar. One lone Sister of Battle they tortured to the point of madness – then left where she could someday strike fear into the hearts of others by muttering of the horrors she had seen.
5100210	On the day that the Ork army smashed the Sisters of Battle, Warboss Gorgutz saw such things as he had never guessed could fight under the banner of the Imperium. Although they were no Orks, they had fought heartily enough, and he was not sure that they were any less burny than his burniest boys. He suspected that they even had their own form of Waaagh!, although anyone knows you can’t have a Waaagh! without proper banners.
5100211	Gorgutz and his elite guard claimed many trophies from the gear of the Sisterhood, being a type of human soldier they had heard of, but never before encountered. For years to come, the formidable Warboss was obsessed by the winged flight of the Living Saint who had fought him, going so far as to ask his best Mek Boys to see about making him wings of a similar kind.
5100212	Commander Or’es’Ka was perturbed by the religious zealotry, which he witnessed in the Sisters of Battle. In it he saw, perhaps, a twisted mockery of his own devotion to the Greater Good. When the Tau brought their military might to bear on the Sisters' stronghold, they found the challenge a perfect example of the closed-minded and closed-fisted approach of the fanatical humans. The remarkable powers that the Sisters of Battle displayed, though they amazed the Tau, could not turn the tide of the battle, and the Tau prevailed.
5100213	It was with some surprise that the Tau found they could not take prisoners of war among these humans, as they had often done in conflicts with the Imperial Guard. The foolish humans insisted on dying, beyond all reason.
5100214	When the battle was fully won, Commander Or’es’Ka ordered the city of the Sama District scoured, so that they could learn the technology that had produced invincibility and the other marvels that had been used against them. Strangely, this technology was gone, and the Tau were unable to account for it.
5100215	The brave soldiers of the Order of the Emperor's Virgins had fully believed themselves girded and steeled against all assault, most of all in their own bastion on Kaurava I. So their surprise was great, indeed, when the Necrons came upon them with irresistible force, making mockeries of their flamers, tanks, and Acts of Faith. Those weapons might have sufficed against the mortal and the living, but alas, the Sisters of Battle faced an entirely different sort of foe. A foe which no prayers succeeded in averting or casting down.
5100216	The Necrons swarmed across the cities of Sama District, swallowing whole all that moved and crushing all that did not. After this was done, where prayers and organ-music had once been heard, silence reigned. Silence, except for the dull throb of the Necron generators, and the dull thunder of the horde, marching off into the distance.
5200000	We welcome your gracious presence, Aun’Ro’Yr.
5200001	I see that our earth caste engineers have made splendid progress in constructing the Nan Yanoi base station.
5200002	Yes, your Eminence, it is nearly complete. There are only a few gaps remaining in our perimeter defenses, and they are heavily guarded until our orbital defense system is fully operational. 
5200003	Excellent. And this Ar’Ka Cannon you have built – quite a marvel, as I understand it. 
5200004	Indeed. From this moon, we can fire on any habitable territory in the Kaurava System. Do you wish to inspect it yourself?
5200005	It harms only advanced life forms, thus avoiding damage to structures and plant life.
5200006	 This is indeed most commendable.
5200007	What is that?
5200008	The perimeter has somehow been breached. I must attend to this. Please, your Excellence, return to the Coalition Center.
5200009	Yes, that may be best.
5200010	Dispatch Pathfinders. Locate the source of the breach and see that they do not gain entrance and establish a foothold. Notify all Fire Warriors and Kroot Carnivore squads.
5200011	Let us hope that our defenses are strong enough to hold them.
5200012	Ya see, Big Boss Gorgutz? Dis 'erez da strongest an' bestest Ork'old as ever 'eld a Ork.
5200013	Oi’s that so, then?
5200014	Ain’t no ‘umies got in ‘ere – eva! . Wif da Rokclaw Mountins all ‘round us, deyz only one way in.
5200015	Even if they wuz ta get in, they’d have all da boyz to face. Oh, an’ da Nobz. An’ da tanks – den dere’s da Squigoffs. 
5200016	Say they beat all that.  
5200017	Datz when we git ‘em wit da Fighta-Bommaz. We’d squash ‘em to a pulp! 
5200018	Hmmph.
5200019	We gots wochaz wochin’ day an night. Nobody but an Ork gets close to us wiffout we see ‘em and crush ‘em ta smivvereenz.
5200020	Boss! Boss! Deyz enemies in da camp!
5200021	Wot? In da camp? We gotta stop ‘em afore dey getz to da Killy Spot! Da drums – beat da drums! Get 'em!!!
5200022	Wotz dis ‘ere Killy Spot?
5200023	Beat da drums!
5200024	Waaagh!
5200025	We gotz ta hold da Killy Spot! 
5200026	Humph! Bestest Ork’old ever, huh?
5200027	Everything is in order, then?
5200028	Yes, sir.
5200029	How are the men?
5200030	Tolerable, sir.
5200031	Morale?
5200032	Good at Central, poor on the front.
5200033	Casualties?
5200034	The same, sir.
5200035	Firing squads?
5200036	Twenty today. Twelve for cowardice in the line of duty.
5200037	Baneblade production?
5200038	Tank crew, munitions and parts are arriving by convoy on schedule, sir. As you know it takes only the most highly trained crew to properly operate a –
5200039	I know.
5200040	Very good, General.
5200041	How many do we have on hand?
5200042	Unfortunately, sir, a shipment of one hundred Baneblades had just gone out to serve–
5200043	I see.
5200044	Look at this.
5200045	Once this was a fine city. Gleaming beacon of the Emperor’s light – a center of industry. Now look at it.
5200046	Commissar, I would like to see this city built up again. I would like to see towers and spires of gleaming white. I would like to see our men on parade routes, not tours of duty. I would like to see every city in this planet, every colony in this besotted, miserable system turned to the service and industry of the Imperium, in the Emperor’s name.
5200047	In the Emperor’s name, Sir.
5200048	But to see my dreams fulfilled, first we must wipe the system clean of these blasted xenos and heretics and monsters, and... and zealots.
5200049	And to do that, this base, our center of command, must operate free of danger or harassment. 
5200050	Our troops are ready. Our tanks, our sentinels, and if the Emperor wills it, we will have functioning Baneblades. Tell me, Commissar – are we prepared? Or will we be lambs taken to slaughter?
5200051	Well! We will do what we can - and pray for victory. The enhanced Basilisk cannon has been prepared by our Techpriest Enginseers, has it not? It can be fired at will?
5200052	It only requires an artillery spotter. We shall place our faith in the God-Emperor.
5200053	That will have to do the job. As always, we place faith in the Emperor.
5200054	Commander Boreale – enemy forces in our perimeter.
5200055	Where?
5200056	Southern quadrant, but they were on the move. Current location unknown.
5200057	There is no time to be lost. Battle Brothers!
5200058	Space Marines – today the enemy is at our door. 
5200059	We know our duty, and we will do it. We fight for our honor as Blood Ravens, as Space Marines … and we fight in the name of the Emperor!
5200060	<spirited troop rally shout>
5200061	And if we die this day, we die in glory. We die heroes’ deaths … but we shall not die. No! It is the enemy who will taste death and defeat. As you know…
5200062	Most of our Battle Brothers are stationed in space, prepared to deep strike. 
5200063	Our perimeter has been prepared in the event that our enemies should be so bold and so foolish. We have placed numerous beacons, allowing for multiple, simultaneous, and devastating defensive deep strikes.
5200064	The Codex Astartes names this maneuver Steel Rain. We will descend upon the foe, we will overwhelm them … we will leave none alive. Meanwhile, our ground forces will ensure the full defense of our headquarters.
5200065	We are the Space Marines! We are the Emperor’s fury!
5200066	<cheer>
5200067	So, they come.
5200068	Awake… I give you energy. Drink of it… and awake.
5200069	They shall meet their ends. They shall join the army of death.
5200070	They approach. We are prepared?
5200071	Yes, Farseer, but –
5200072	Yes?
5200073	Must we fight?
5200074	We shall fight. They must never suspect. 
5200075	They shall come, expecting the obvious, the simple, the artless. They shall stab at the shadows with confused minds and troubled hearts. Meanwhile, we shall appear unseen from ten directions, and from every one strike a fatal blow.
5200076	Do you know the history of this place, which we call Essel ir-Talith and the young races call the Upper Wastes?
5200077	We the Eldar made our war camp here, in a past age?
5200078	Yes, that is so. Our ancestors came here to fight the Necrons when they were an overwhelming wave that swept the worlds. This system was one of their stages of destruction, their foundries of undeath. Our ancestors defeated them here.
5200079	We constructed our war operations center here as an illusion. No brute army, no simple display of force could uncover its secrets, and none ever shall.
5200080	No, it is more than an illusion. It is a clever trap, this place our ancestors forged. It is a net covered in leaves that the savage beast willingly stands on, tempted by a bloody morsel– only to find itself hoisted, trapped, at the hunter’s mercy.
5200081	No, we shall guard our secret. No force can strike a target it cannot find. We shall not yield up our foothold on this world. Kaurava was once ours, and shall be ours again. 
5200082	We came here long, long ago. 
5200083	We did battle with our deathless foes, the Necrons, and won. This day… this day we have lost. If they swarm again like locusts here, some other must stop them.
5200084	For we shall be gone.
5200085	All I’ve fought for… all my work! Crushed! Crushed! All the good men who gave their lives for this cursed, this blasted system…
5200086	Though my army lies in ruins today… I have not done fighting. And I will remember who my enemies are…. 
5200087	They come!
5200088	They come!!!
5200089	They come.
5200090	Yes, we feel them. They approach.
5200091	They come.
5200092	Their blood shall flow at our feet.
5200093	Blood for the Blood God!
5200094	They shall writhe with our blades in their gut. They shall know pain as they have never before. They shall taste fear like a chill upon their flesh.
5200095	We shall slake our thirsts.
5200096	Yes, we shall slake our thirsts for death, for Chaos, for terror. Yes!
5200097	Blood for the Blood God!
5200098	They draw near. Let them come.
5200099	The very ground will poison you. Daemons will appear from the Warp when your back is turned. We shall lash out from every direction and yours shall be the cries of death and horror. 
5200100	The sound of your doom will ring in your skull, in your soul… you shall tremble. And your blood shall be a gift to the Blood God.
5200101	Let them come. We are ready.
5200102	No! No! We cannot lose… we cannot die… how can we?!
5200103	Without our devotion.  
5200104	Without our sacrifice.
5200105	The horrid blossom of Chaos will wither, will die!
5200106	This world… is slipping… from our grasp…
5200107	Aun’Ro’Yr! Noble Ethereal! Oh, we have lost you – we have lost all!
5200108	My Ork’old! My bootiful Ork’old!
5200109	Oi’ve ‘ad enuff a dis! 
5200110	C’mon boyz, let’s get outta ‘ere!
5200111	We have failed…
5200112	… the Emperor ..
5200113	Good, she comes.
5200114	Sisters – the Living Holy Saint of the Emperor, Saint Anais, Scourge of Heretics.
5200115	Now, in the name of the Emperor!
5200116	Good.
5200117	There, it is done.
5200118	May the Emperor’s blessing carry us on to victory, Sisters.
5200119	We thank you, honored martyr.
5200120	So.
5200121	It is true then, these blessed shrines will confer… invincibility?
5200122	Indeed. Within each shrine lies a true and sacred relic of the Ecclesiarchy. Now that the edifices have been blessed by a Living Saint, they confer upon her the Inviolable Aura, as scribed and fervently mastered by the great Ecclesiarch, Jonasiah Vuonis. 
5200123	And wherever she goes, no harm may befall us?
5200124	Precisely. Neither our persons nor our belongings.
5200125	One pure, bright candle, amidst a sea of filth and darkness.
5200126	That is well said, Canoness. This is a tainted system. It may, in fact, be irredeemable.
5200127	Then we shall purge it with fire. I have yet to find a cinder that was not faithful in its praise of the Emperor.
5200128	All is made ready?
5200129	Yes, Mistress.
5200130	Good. These would-be conquerors shall have a taste of our fire and faith. The Emperor will punish them through us.
5200131	Sisters, we must go as martyrs. WE must go in flames!
5200132	In flames!
5200133	Ha ha! We are fresh from the fight. We have shed blood. Death, terror, and anguish sang sweetly in our ears.
5200134	Ah, but Lord Tahril, have you taken prizes?
5200135	Do you doubt me, Gruemenael? Many prisoners were taken. We have our tribute to Commorragh, and many left over for our Slave Chambers and your torture grounds.
5200136	Come, Archon, come to my torture grounds.
5200137	We win, we lose, win and lose – but always richer, richer with slaves and spoils. 
5200138	Indeed! We shall be well respected – and rewarded – when we return to Commorragh.
5200139	When we return. If we return! Return the victors… or return the vanquished?
5200140	My grounds. Where screams are flowers, and pain their fragrance. A fine, fine nest we have. High upon the cliff. Hard to see, harder still to reach!
5200141	<cries in pain and fury>
5200142	Will any reach this nest? Will they take away my garden?
5200143	Ha ha!
5200144	Are you questioning my right to lead? My inevitable victory? I am the deadly shadow and the bird of prey. I am the poisoned dagger that brings swift death! 
5200145	<groans like a soldier, bearing the pain of torture>
5200146	These crude and foolish armies know nothing of strategy. If they see a wall they attack it. If they see an army, they charge at it. They will be too busy with each other to notice us, or if they do, it will be too late.
5200147	Worry not. And it is of no matter – we keep a keen watch. If an army approached, surely we would see it coming. Then – we would tear it to pieces!
5200148	Tahril, you fool! I will have your head for this!
5200149	Quickly, back to Commorragh!
5200150	Well! If he had died, I should have taken his place! Now, I must flee.
5200151	Our new base defense system is built using the same technology. Both are controlled from this location.
5200152	It was the sudden appearance of a Warp Storm at the Kaurava System’s outer edge that first caught the attention of the Imperium – and not just the Imperium. 
5200153	After hundreds of years under the neglectful watch of the Imperial Guard,
5200154	nearly every force in the galaxy would descend upon the planets of Kaurava, bent only on domination and victory.
5200155	Three races had long dwelled in there: the Imperial Guard, its supposed rulers.
5200156	the Ork tribes of Kaurava II, which the Guard had never successfully put down.
5200157	and the Necron, who had slept undisturbed for untold millennia beneath Kaurava III. 
5200158	Where the Chaos Space Marines came from, or how, none can say. Did the Warp Storm bring them… or did they bring the Warp Storm?
5200159	Both appeared suddenly on Kaurava IV and in an eye-blink
5200160	half the system’s Imperial forces were gone – killed or claimed by the madness of Chaos.
5200161	The transformation of the planet from one of fine imperial cities and pasture-lands into the thick wilds of Chaos was almost as fast and as brutal.
5200162	In quick succession, the others flocked to Kaurava. The Space Marines, the Imperium’s super-soldiers, descended on Kaurava II, planning to finally cleanse the system both of the troublesome Orks and the Chaos Space Marines, their sworn mortal enemies.
5200163	The Tau appeared next, not far above, on one of the planet’s moons.
5200164	In the interests of protecting its ordered Empire from the effects of human folly, the Tau came seeking to contain the Warp Storm and, in so doing, expand their territory’s border.
5200165	On their moon they built a mighty fortress, and there forged a space cannon capable of interplanetary devastation.
5200166	Among the wastes of Kaurava III, the Necrons, perhaps awakened by the disruptive forces of the Warp Storm, slowly massed their lethal legions.
5200167	In quick response, Webway Gates, long unused, flickered to life, and Eldar poured forth, ready to battle their dark, death-dealing adversaries.
5200168	Meanwhile, in the shadow of an ancient portal gate, the Dark Eldar slipped stealthily out of the murky depths of the Webway.
5200169	There, on the moon of Kaurava IV, these twisted pillagers and torturers, cruel cousins to the Eldar, built their nest.
5200170	They would be like carrion birds, flying above the battlefield – and, when all were weary from the fight, make the battlefield into a feasting ground.
5200171	Last to arrive, and perhaps most to be feared, were the Sisters of Battle, holy maidens and bearers of the God-Emperor’s faith.
5200172	They had come to cleanse this system of corruption and filth. Their faith left them fanatical – unafraid of death and zealous in their cause. Nothing here was clean. All must be purged.
5200173	The Kaurava System itself is unique. It is rumored that these worlds hale from a prior age of the Eldar race, before their schism, before their exodus.
5200174	Four terraformed planets, and seven Ancient Gates are all that remain of that time.
5200175	Now, war rages anew, and only the victorious may write their history.  Only the victorious will claim the planets of Kaurava.
5200176	Our orbital defenses were built using the same technology. Both are controlled from this location.
5200177	Wither and die!
5200178	Under the visionary leadership of Warboss Gorgutz, the Orks achieved a complete and unrivalled victory over all four planets of the Kaurava System. Generations of Kauravan Orks had dreamed of such a day – never imagining that they would not only overthrow the Imperial Guard, but seven other armies to achieve their aim.
5200179	All Kaurava was soon overrun and teeming with Orks. A phase of wild looting and pillaging was followed by Ork settlement, wherein clans laid claim to entire territories at a time. Without the watchful eye of Gorgutz, however, all this would have ended in confusion and petty clan warfare.
5200180	Gorgutz had other, greater plans. The four planets of Kaurava were to be turned to this purpose. Mines yielded valuable metals and fields of Orkish factories produced everything required for a proper campaign of galactic conquest – a Great Waaagh! staged from such an excellent platform and supplied with such resilient, war-worthy Orks. How could such a Waaagh! result in anything but great victories and greater glory? They hailed their mighty leader, Warboss Gorgutz, Lord a’ all Ko-Ruvva.
5200181	The 252nd Kauravan Conservator Regiment proved their right to rule in no uncertain terms. General Vance Stubbs ability to organize and reform this long-neglected army did not go unnoticed by the Segmentum top brass. His career could not fail to rise, in time, beyond the role of Governor-General to a small star system.
5200182	For the time being, however, Stubbs busied himself and his proud regiment in post-war reconstruction. Thankfully, the Warp Storm vanished of its own accord. Kaurava IV was suitable for re-settlement. Only Kaurava III did not feel the commotion of construction, mining, and terraforming. This planet was left largely barren. Who could say what else slept beneath those sands?
5200183	In time, the system became a proud Imperial hub, and famed Guard academies turned out superior infantry, second only to Kasr itself. Kaurava became home to proud human populations, warlike and devoted to the Emperor. In these times, it would be hard to imagine that a bloody war had been fought, or that heresy and Chaos had ever been there. 
5200184	On arriving in the Kaurava System, Confessor Treganum March had remarked to Canoness Selena Agna that he would not be surprised if the place were so corrupt, that it all must be put to the torch. In retrospect, these words seemed prophetic. Everywhere they looked, the Sisters of Battle found only weakness, heresy, and abomination.
5200185	Chaos had nearly devoured the entire system, beginning with the fourth planet. Added to this was the Warp Storm, which had vanished shortly after their defeat. It hardly seemed likely that any Imperial Guard or Space Marines could have avoided corruption in such circumstances. Although tragic, it was necessary to perform a field-inquisition and purge every one of them.
5200186	When the Sisters of Battle had finished their cleansing, the star system was officially dedicated to their Order. Relics of their great victories during the Kaurava Conflict were placed in the founding of six great Ecclesiarchal Cities, each devoted to one of the Orders Militant of the Sisterhood. Pilgrims journeyed from across the galaxy to these retreats, and many millions of Sisters gathered there, for prayer and preparation, in the bastion of Holy Kaurava.
5200187	It was no surprise that only the likes of the Blood Ravens should prevail in a battle so hard-fought  and entrenched as the Kaurava Conflict had proved. Under the capable guidance of Force Commander Indrick Boreale, the Ravens 9th Company had acquitted themselves faultlessly. It was unfortunate that, in following their orders, they had been compelled to neutralize the armies of the Imperial Guard and Sisterhood. But such was war.
5200188	Without doubt the finest hour the Blood Ravens had known was their triumph over the vile forces of Chaos. A Space Marine can aspire to no greater honor than fighting, and defeating, those treacherous blasphemers. Within days of the Blood Ravens victory, the Warp Storm had vanished as mysteriously as it had come.
5200189	After the war was won, a new Fortress-Monastery was founded in the Lands of Solitude. That territory was given a new name: Borealum. Meanwhile, fresh Imperial Guard troops were brought to the Kaurava System, to constitute a new and better regulated Planetary Defense Force.
5200190	Defeating eight powerful armies was a potent demonstration of the “Great Strength, Great Strike” tactics which Commander Or’es’Ka espoused. Although his theories had been met with skepticism before, his superiors now debated the merits of such strategies, and ways to incorporate them into standard Tau warfare.
5200191	With the Kaurava Conflict definitively settled, Commander Or’es’Ka’s first cautious step was to complete and upgrade the defenses of the Nan Yanoi stronghold. Meanwhile the Warp Storm, which was the purported reason the Tau had entered the Kaurava System, silently folded in upon itself and vanished.
5200192	With the Warp Storm gone, the Tau fleets began to make their way to Kaurava untroubled, and a massive colonization project then began. Commander Or’es’Ka was not to stay in the system, which had found peace in the Greater Good. Instead, the Ethereal Aun’ro’Yr assumed leadership, guiding the way towards Kaurava becoming a full-fledged Sept of the Tau Empire.
5200193	At the end of the bloody contest, only the Eldar army remained standing. The Necron had been returned to the depths of Kaurava III, and all those who would meddle, pillage, or spread Chaos throughout the galaxy were gone. Farseer Caerys had succeeded in her task – she had led her people among the branching roads of the future, to the best possible of ends.
5200194	The Biel-Tan Eldar then scoured the planets of the Kaurava System, destroying all vestiges of the war, machine and soldier alike. All, that is, except for those Imperial Guard troops who had somehow survived the defeat. These surviving Guardsmen eventually contacted Segmentum Command. When fresh Imperial forces arrived, no trace of the victors could be found. What had taken place could not be explained.
5200195	A new Imperial regiment was instituted, this time under greater Ecclesiarchal surveillance, and rebuilding began. Strangely however, all efforts to colonize the third planet met with inexplicable disaster. Eventually, embarrassed and unable to explain, the new Governor-General simply abandoned the planet. Occasionally, he would receive strange reports – of slender, swift-moving figures and alien-looking arches, which would appear and then vanish again, without a trace.
5200196	Once, in another age, the Necrons had fought a great war in the Kaurava Sytem, and lost. Awakened again so many millennia later, they found new, strange, and terrible armies around them. This time, however, profiting from the confusion of the living, they would not be denied victory.
5200197	The dark gods that the Necrons served hated life. Everywhere across the conquered planets of the Kaurava System, the defeated everywhere were taken up and transformed into the listless, lifeless footsoldiers who would one day finally blot out all life, everywhere. Through their servitude, the ancient gods grew in strength and power.
5200198	Soon the planets teemed with the dark forms of the Necron army. Great Tomb Ships stood guard, while others launched on excursions of conquest. In all doings, their enemies succumbed quickly in confusion and terror. This was no accident. Where the Kauravan Necrons went, their god, the Great Deceiver, ever clouded the minds of their foes.
5200199	Once there was a simple soldier, who was ignorant that he possessed latent abilities as a psyker. Without training, he could not guard himself, and the gods of Chaos whispered to him – driving him feverishly mad. They made him carry out certain plans, perform certain black rites, so that a terrible rift in space and time was forged. Chaos poured out. The Word Bearers Legion appeared, and the Warp Storm blossomed from the rift. The gods gloried in their deed.
5200200	Led by Chaos Lord Firaeveus Carron, the Word Bearers Legion spread, slaughtered, and conquered. No force, not even their mortal enemies, the Imperial Space Marines, could withstand their wrath. Nine armies vied for the Kaurava System, and Chaos proved mightiest of them all.
5200201	The four Kauravan planets now teem with the strange and twisted forms of Chaos. Daemons walk openly and a Warp Storm grows in size and strength. The Word Bearers Legion, under Lord Carron, make ready for a far greater war against their oldest and most hated of enemies: the Imperium of Man.
5200202	With the last major threat removed, the Dark Eldar were now free to roam through the Kaurava System, pillaging and laying waste as they saw fit. Like gruesome locusts, the Black Heart Kabal darkened the skies with their vehicles, descending on territory after territory, laying claim to prisoners and other spoils.
5200203	The speed and ravening hunger with which these raids were carried out was remarkable. Nothing could escape them. Nothing could outrun them. The keen senses of the Dark Eldar seemed to pierce all cover in search of their prey. It was not long before all Kaurava was stripped bare and devoid of life.
5200204	Back on the moon of Lacunae, cages grew full of captives and more cages were built. Archon Tahril and his master, Lord Vect, sat and supped goblets filled with the souls of their enemies. The Haemonculus Gruemenael cackled gleefully over his victims. As the Warp Storm quietly disappeared, so too did the Dark Eldar vanish, returned to the Webway to revel, then go in search of new, fresh worlds to pillage and enslave.
5200205	Now! ... Fire!
5200206	<takes a bullet and dies>
5200207	Stand aside.
5200208	Now, my Sisters. In the Emperor's name!
5200209	<evil laughter. he's just done something terribly clever>
5200210	<savage shout of multiple warriors>
5200211	
5200212	
5200213	
5200214	
5200215	
5200216	
5200217	
5200218	
5200219	
5300000	The Eldar stronghold lies directly below us. Let us strike, before they suspect anything.
5300001	The Eldar headquarters, directly below us. Move quickly men. Leave nothing standing, or moving.
5300002	Come, Sisters. Down there is the Eldar stronghold. We will purge it with fire, and claim this land in the Emperor’s name.
5300003	There they are! There! Go kill them all! Burn their base! Plant the flag of Chaos!
5300004	There, we gaze upon it. The stronghold of our false kin. The cowards! Let us move with deadly speed and silence, and blot out these fools from off this world.
5300005	Look ‘ere, ya zoggin’ runts. Down dere, dat’s da pointy-ear big fort. We blast that, we blast ‘em all offa Ko-ruvva. So get dem blastas and shootas ready, cuz we gots some fightin’ to do, is wot we’ve got.
5300006	Fire Warriors, we stand before the Eldar central command. We are commanded to decimate the target. If we fight with skill and honor, victory will be ours.
5300007	Our old … foes … are there … destroy them…
5300008	Now!
5300009	How little you understand the Eldar. You have stepped into our snare. Do not expect to escape it alive.
5300010	You want to do this the hard way? That is acceptable to the Imperial Guard!
5300011	Hide all you want, Eldar, we will come and find you.
5300012	By the Emperor’s wrath… you will pay for these feeble deceits…
5300013	What? What! Tricked – deceived! Arrrrrgh…. You’ll pay, fools! You will pay, in blood!
5300014	Gah! Run while you can, Caerys. I am angry now. I am faster than you, and when I catch you, your death will be slow… and exquisite.
5300015	Aaaaugh! Where’d dey go? Come back ‘an fight, ya squiggs!
5300016	We have failed to anticipate the advanced Eldar tactics. We must not be fooled again.
5300017	Find… them….
5300018	More Warp Spiders and Rangers are needed on the field. Send word to their base-camp, and have it down immediately.
5300019	Why are there not more Nightwings in the air? Need I remind you, we are at war? Deploy all interceptors immediately.
5300020	What, another stronghold? Let’s hope this is the last. Now just how’re we going to get over there?
5300021	Well, well. There is another base. Smoke and mirrors! We will strike you over there, too.
5300022	What? Yet another central command discovered. Ah! These wretched xenos are infuriating.
5300023	More strongholds? More to destroy! Fools, no stones or walls can hold us back. We are Chaos! You cannot hide from us…You, find out how to get in there.
5300024	So, another hidden headquarters. Up to your old tricks, my cowardly kin? And you think that will stop us for long?
5300025	Wot? Dat’s not da real base, neiver? Wwwwwwuh! When I get’s over dere, Ise gonna – first we gotta get all da boyz in dere, huh?
5300026	Look, Commander Or’es’Ka, there is another, concealed stronghold. We will strive to discover a path to this location.
5300027	Find … a way … there …
5300028	General Stubbs, strange energy signatures have been detected. Sir, should we look into it?
5300029	Commander Boreale, we have detected unusual energy patterns nearby. We await orders to investigate?
5300030	Hmm… it seems there is an unknown type of energy being emitted from several locations in the field of battle. Perhaps it would be best if we shed some light on these…
5300031	Most terrible and feared lord! We have – we have found – there are strange energies! We don’t know them. They come from – from just a few p-p-p-places on the map!
5300032	Archon – we have detected energy sources which can be nothing, if not special field generators, employed by our devious cousins. We have scried several points of origin.
5300033	Wot’s dis? Ennigy wotzits, blinkerin’ right ‘ere under me nose? More pointy-eared tricks, is wot dat is! Ennigy spots, is it…
5300034	Our sensors have identified strange energy patterns of an unknown form, Commander. They have been detected at multiple sources, nearby.
5300035	… I … sense … hidden … power… 
5300036	Farseer, they have disabled one of the illusion barrier devices.
5300037	They have disabled all the illusion barriers! This never should have come to pass! We have few chances left – we must fight! We must prevail.
5300038	Blast those turrets! Hmm…must be some way to shut them down.
5300039	We will force our way right past all those turrets if we have to, but look sharp, brothers. If there is some other way, we will take it.
5300040	Emperor smite these turrets! Is our only choice to travel this valley of death?
5300041	Turrets! Cursed turrets! Make them stop! Make them stop, I will never have my throne of Eldar skulls!
5300042	You see, they have prepared a fools promenade for us, with these Support Platforms lining the way. However… there may be another way…
5300043	Grakey, wot’s all dem shooty bits? We ain’t gunna march right through all a dem! Wot we gunna do?
5300044	Fire Warriors! Our enemy fights not directly, but by devious means, with this array of turrets prepared for intruders. So we must endeavor to be indirect, as well.
5300045	Beware… turrets… 
5300046	Farseer! They have disabled the Support Platform Array! The entrance is no longer protected.
5300047	Yes, I have seen this. Do not yet despair, my sister. They have not foreseen our every move.
5300048	They are upon us, Farseer! Is it time?
5300049	Almost. Not yet.
5300050	Now! Quickly – to safety!
5300051	Damn them! Where are they now? I suppose we’ll have to find another one of those barrier shield generators, won’t we?
5300052	Gone? Again? Brothers, scour the area for another of those barrier devices.
5300053	What madness is this? Do they think they can run forever? Do they think that the purging light of the Emperor will not find and pierce their mortal hearts? Sisters, look for more of these barrier field devices.
5300054	Gone? Gone? Gone?!? Find them! Find them and break their bones! Don’t just stand there! Go!!!
5300055	These petty tricks grow wearisome. There must be a way to reach this new area. Seek another field generator. And do not tarry!
5300056	Awwwright. Dese ‘ere pointy-ears done enough a dis ‘ere zappin’ ‘round and hidin’ from da Orks. I say it’s time ta show ‘em Waaagh! Ork-style. Ready up boyz, find da way in dere, and we’ll blast ‘em all ta zog!
5300057	They have eluded us again, but we will hunt patiently, and the quarry will be ours. Fire Warriors, we must search for a way in to their new location.
5300058	We follow… there is … no … escape …
5300059	You think to defeat us? You do not even know where to look for us. And you will be dead long before you do.
5300060	We will strike when you do not expect us. You will try to strike back, but in vain – we will not be there.
5300061	Be strong of heart, warriors. We shall prevail.
5300062	If we perish, so does our last Eldar foothold on this ancient world.
5300063	General, they approach.
5300064	Hmph! Let them. When will we have our Baneblades?
5300065	Crew and munitions are arriving by convoy. It… it will be several convoys before we have one operational, sir.
5300066	So we just have to keep them busy until then.
5300067	Baneblade convoy dispatched and en route.
5300068	General, the first convoy shipment has arrived.
5300069	Good. Are we ready to dispatch a Baneblade?
5300070	This is the 55th Assault Company, ready to roll, reporting from the Western Annex.
5300071	17th Light Armored Battalion, reporting for duty.
5300072	Shakun Artillery Squad, Central Annex, reporting for duty.
5300073	Your orders are to deploy directly against the enemy. Proceed.
5300074	General, the 94th Heavy Armored Company, Northern Annex, is combat-ready.
5300075	Tell them to get moving, and give those bastards hell.
5300076	The Basilisk Magnus is cleared for action, General. It can now fire at any acquired coordinates.
5300077	And our spotters?
5300078	Awaiting orders, sir.
5300079	Get them on the field! In the Emperor’s name, we don’t have time to lose!
5300080	We have uncloaked a spotter, Sir. This is how they are firing their artillery – with infiltrated spotters.
5300081	An infiltrated spotter has been discovered. It seems they are using these spotters to aim their artillery fire.
5300082	A sneak? A sneak! With a mortar shell tied to his tail! Well! Well – we’ll cut it off. And feed the tailless sniveling little rat to our gods!
5300083	Farseer, a cloaked scout has been intercepted. No doubt, he was acting a spotter to direct their artillery fire.
5300084	Haha! What have we here? Thought they could slip a cloaked scout in and aim their artillery on us, did they? We’ll put a stop to that.
5300085	Wot’s dis? Why it’s a hidy-humie, tryin’ to sneak in and get us all blowed up. Thought you could send yer big gunz our way, eh? Har har.
5300086	Commander, a cloaked spotter has been uncovered. We believe he was directing the aim of their giant artillery. We should take measures to prevent such spotters.
5300087	I see… you… little spotter. Do not… aim… your guns… at me…
5300088	Locked on target. Fire when ready.
5300089	Locked on target.
5300090	Target locked.
5300091	Fire when ready.
5300092	Artillery, fire when ready.
5300093	They’ve caught me. Fire! Fire now!
5300094	I’ve been caught! Fire!
5300095	They got me. Quickly… fire!
5300096	Fire… now.
5300097	Entering Alert Level One.
5300098	Entering Alert Level Two.
5300099	Entering Alert Level Three.
5300100	Entering Alert Level Four.
5300101	Dammit! We’ve lost too many convoys that way. Send them on another route.
5300102	General, the Mechanized Command that the convoys were being dispatched from has been taken out.
5300103	Well, use a different one, then. And quickly!
5300104	No, Sir. Several more convoys will be required.
5300105	Well –
5300106	Sir, there are no more Mechanized Commands. There will be no more convoys.
5300107	Golden Throne protect us now...
5300108	We’re under attack! Quick, man the Sentinels!
5300109	That’s our last Sentinel. Build more. Quickly! Load your lasguns, men! For the Imperium!
5300110	Here they come. Get those Chimera up and running. On the double! 
5300111	These Chimera are useless! Hold them off until we can build more of them!
5300112	94th Heavy Armored Company! To your tanks!
5300113	Our tanks! To the death, men! For the Imperium, and for glory!
5300114	Ah, they are preparing to march to their doom.
5300115	I’m looking forward to hacking the heads of these traitors from their useless bodies.
5300116	Look sharp, men. Looks like we have some tough, urban warfare ahead of us.
5300117	The traitors cower within this city, Brothers. Be ever ready.
5300118	Be wary, my Sisters. These heretical scum may creep behind every piece of wall or rubble.
5300119	Be keen of eyes, my kin. Within the confines of this city, we know not what lurks in wait.
5300120	This was once a human city. Faugh! Would that I had burnt and pillaged here.
5300121	Wot’s ‘ere, a city, is it? Bah! Too many spots for ‘em ta hide like snivellin’ grots!
5300122	We must move with caution, for our enemy could easily have traps and ambushes planted among such ruins.
5300123	There … has been … death … here …
5300124	This city was ours… How many millions did we lose to this - to this madness?
5300125	Long have I waited for this moment of vengeance.
5300126	Support me, Emperor, for I tread in the lair of our enemy.
5300127	Long I have seen these bloodstained streets in dream.
5300128	These barbaric fools will scream just as sweetly, when I run my blade through them.
5300129	Ain’t no soddin’ ‘umies gonna stop ‘Eadhunter Gorgutz. Dis’ll be a Ork world. Dis’ll be my world!
5300130	We must not be daunted by the madness of our enemy.
5300131	We ... bring death … to … the mad …
5300132	They are shooting down my Hell Talons. Build more! Do you hear me!
5300133	Defilers! We need more. Make more! Send them – send them against the fools who would dare attack us. 
5300134	You think one shrine will sap my strength? No! I am strong! For here the Warp is strong! It is our power, and your weakness, and you shall DIE!
5300135	Smite, them, Khorne! Smite them, my god! They are taking away the shrines we made for you! How can you let them? We – we will be your fist, and we shall take them by the throat. Yes! Yes! We will!
5300136	Another? Another shrine… fallen? After all our work… after all those sacrifices?
5300137	You will pay! Pay for tearing down my shrines! The veil is lifted, see! See the army I have! You have earned our wrath. We will spill your blood!
5300138	You die today!
5300139	There! That statue is what we are after. See how Chaos ripples across it? Don’t be surprised when daemons jump out of it.
5300140	There is one of their shrines. Careful – it is corrupted, and can spew daemons at us.
5300141	That is the heretical shrine. Beware! It is an opening: daemons may enter there.
5300142	There is the shrine. Can you see, my kin, how it flickers with Chaos? The minions of Khorne may enter our world through it.
5300143	See, that is one of their shrines. Their horror squads will enter through it.
5300144	See boyz, dat dere is da Chaos shrine. If ya’s don’t wanna get dead, lookout. It’s got daemons in it as jump out an’ getcha…
5300145	Behold this shrine of Chaos. Each shrine is as a small storm, and the creatures of Chaos may issue from it.
5300146	The shrine … daemons … will come … from … there…
5300147	An ambush!
5300148	It’s a trap!
5300149	Watch out, Sisters. An ambush!
5300150	We are ambushed.
5300151	What? Lay a trap for us?
5300152	Gork! Where’d dey come from?
5300153	We have been led into a trap!
5300154	Trapped…
5300155	Taste the full power of Chaos! Taste my magics, and beg for mercy!
5300156	They’re attacking the shrine. Stop them!
5300157	They’re at the Relic! Get on board – we attack!
5300158	Now is the moment! Now is the hour! Now is the time we earn honor and glory in the eyes of the blood god, Khorne, who is our master!
5300159	We fight for Chaos!
5300160	Slay the enemy! Slaaaay!
5300161	Steel yourselves, my Sisters. The time of battle draws near.
5300163	Our faith is great. My children, we shall make a crusade against the enemies of the Emperor. Where I go, do ye gather, and take up arms, for I shall lead you to victory… or glorious martyrdom.
5300164	Infidels! Dispatching a few missionaries will not staunch our faith, or halt our crusade!
5300165	They strike at our Convents. Well! We are not yet short of the Faithful, and ready for battle!
5300166	Emperor, be the guide and shield of our sacred tanks!
5300167	Our faith is once again strong. To the crusade, and death to the enemy!
5300168	Unworthy fools! You shall not harm this holy place!
5300170	Deep strike squads, prepare for deployment. Brothers, strike at will.
5300171	Assault Team Bravo – ATTACK!
5300172	We have lost one of the deep strike beacons, sir.
5300173	Yes, we have.
5300174	Sir, every beacon we lose reduces our ability to strike on the field.
5300175	Do you think I care if we lose a beacon or two? This is war. War! All we need is enough Battle Brothers on the ground that we can crush them under our boot heels and destroy them with our bolters. That is what matters, Space Marine. 
5300176	This is gonna be easy. They won’t see us coming.
5300177	Sir, we have lost nearly half of our deep strike beacons.
5300178	Damn. We have got to hit them harder. This is Commander Boreale to Relay… send us all the units you have. Do you hear? 
5300179	Affirmative, Commander.
5300180	Not enough Predator Tanks for you?
5300181	Hardly.
5300182	Misuse the Emperor’s gifts, blasphemers!
5300183	Ha ha ha ha ha!
5300184	Do you hope to frighten us, humans?
5300185	Hardly.
5300186	Har har! 
5300187	We are prepared for your battle vehicles, Gue’la.
5300188	...
5300189	Good. We will send more.
5300190	Predator Tanks. Hmm… if we can find their Machine Cult building, we would do well to take it out of commission.
5300191	It will not do to be flanked by these Predator tanks. Perhaps we should cut them off… at the source.
5300192	Blast the tanks! Curse them! Rot them with rust and metal maggots. Find their hatching ground, and set it on fire!
5300193	These Predator tanks grow wearisome. Perhaps it is worth our while to deprive them of their tank factories…
5300194	What is this? Tanks? Whoever can remove this nuisance from our path will have first pick of slaves, on the morrow.
5300195	Oi’ve seen dose humie tanks before. Nuffink but trouble, they is. I know wot – we oughta smash da Mek shops dose came from, is wot.
5300196	Commander, Predator class tanks have been sighted on the battlefield. May I recommend neutralizing these threats at the point of origin?
5300197	Predator tanks… stay… out of… my way… or… I will… destroy you all. 
5300208	Looks like they’re ferrying Marines into the field using those Rhino transports. If we could take out the transports, that would slow them down.
5300209	Those Rhino transports are giving them the advantage of speed. If we could find the Machine Cult buildings producing them, it might slow them down.
5300210	Look, Rhinos! Rhinos! Our enemies hide in metal boxes, the cowards! The fools! We – we should take away their metal boxes!
5300211	See, sisters and brothers – those Rhino transports grant them the element of speed. If we were to destroy the vehicle bays that are producing them, then that advantage would be ours alone, would it not?
5300212	Look at their pathetic transports, which cannot fly, which have no guns. They are weak mimics of our own Raiders. Still… we should tear their factories to pieces, all the same.
5300213	Look at ‘dem humies, hidin’ in da steel boxes. Har har! We Orks’ll peel off da top and eat da pink-skins inside! Boyz, if youze finds where dey comin’ from, stomp ‘em ta bits. You hear?
5300214	Do you see, Fire Warriors, how they use transports to quickly move their men to the front lines? If we take from them their transport factory, we take from them speed and agility.
5300215	Destroy… the transport… factories…
5300216	Space Marines… attack!
5300217	Make us proud, brothers.
5300219	Land Raider has entered the battle!
5300220	Fire the Orbital Bombardment. Immediately.
5300221	Sir, they’re right on top of us… the collateral –
5300222	Fire! We are Space Marines! If we are to die, our enemies will die beside us!
5300223	<cheer>
5300224	General Stubbs, Field Command and Techpriest have been deployed, and are ready for active duty.
5300225	Force Commander Boreale, we have a Stronghold and a Servitor. We can commence building.
5300226	Canoness, the Chapel and Servitor have arrived. The operation may commence. I suspect the road before is long and winding.
5300227	Good. We have our Stronghold and a heretic. Now get to work!
5300228	Ah! I see the Kabal Fortress has been summoned. A slave, too. We shall build quickly and stay on the attack.
5300229	Lissen up, boyz. We gotz a settlement and some grots, right? Dat means its time for dis 'ere Waaagh! ta get goin’. So get goin’!!!
5300230	Commander Or’es’Ka, our Cadre Headquarters and Earth Caste builders have arrived. We await your orders.
5300231	My… Monolith… Scarabs… have come… good…
5300232	Plenty of these cages have our men in them. Let’s bust some open and see if they aren’t still in condition to fight. There’s one cage just up ahead, over there.
5300233	Men, most of the prisoners in this quadrant are Blood Ravens. Our first objective is to set them free, arm them, and push forward. The first cage is right ahead of us.
5300234	Sisters, harken to my words. This prisoner camp holds many of our comrades. We shall march forward and liberate them, wherever we find them bound.  See? One cage lies nearly within reach. It is a sign!
5300235	They have taken my men, and put them in cages, like pets! Come! Free our brethren! We shall grow our numbers until they cower before us! There’s a cage, right there. Break it!
5300236	I sense the presence of many of our true kin here, caged like animals. Their suffering must be immense, unbearable! Let us smash the bars and free them. Those who can, shall fight by our side. One lies before us!
5300237	Rrrrrgh! Wots all me boyz in cages, when dey oughta be snappin’ da necks a’ dem pale-faced pointy-ears! Come on! Smash dem cages. Start wif dat one, right dere!
5300238	Many warriors of the Tau Empire are known to be caged, barbarously, in this area. We must seek and free these prisoners. Those that are able, shall fight by our sides. The first cage lies only at a short distance.
5300239	They… cage… us… but we... shall… free… us… Start… there…
5300240	Welcome back, soldiers.
5300241	Freed. I knew a Blood Raven would hold true. 
5300242	Come, Sisters. You are freed.
5300243	 I have freed you. Now time for revenge!
5300244	I feel for your suffering. You are freed now.
5300245	Come on, boyz! Get up an’ get ready for fightin’!
5300246	You are liberated. Come, we must liberate the others.
5300247	Free…
5300248	Trouble, incoming. We can deal with them.
5300249	Looks like we have been spotted, men.
5300250	We have not eluded detection, Sisters. Very well, we shall fight.
5300251	Ah, Dark Eldar blood to shed!
5300252	Guards have spotted us! Prepare for combat!
5300253	‘Ere comes some fightin’!
5300254	We have been sighted. Fight bravely, warriors.
5300255	Guards…kill them…
5300256	Well, look what escaped from its cage! Now it shall die!
5300257	General, we’ve sighted two Dark Eldar camps in the vicinity. They’ve extremely well defended, and should be avoided.
5300258	Commander. Two enemy camps have been observed nearby. Given our current force, attacking them directly would be ill-advised.
5300259	Canoness, there are two camps of the enemy near to here. They are well-defended, and with our current strength, I do not think that we could take them.
5300260	Lord Carron, I – I saw – I saw two guard camps. They are near here. We – we aren’t strong enough yet. We – we shouldn’t attack.
5300261	Two guard camps lie near here. I sense that we do not yet have sufficient strength to attempt an attack. We must wait until the time is right.
5300262	Warboss! Warboss! Some boyz, we saw dey got two camps full a pointy-ears. Lots a’ pointy-ears! We’d better ‘ave more Boyz, sure, if we wants to stomp dem.
5300263	Commander, two guard stations have been located. Their tactical strength appears to be too great for our current force. Perhaps we should avoid a direct conflict, for the time being.
5300264	Beware… those… camps… until… we are… more…
5300265	Well, if we don’t have ourselves a ragtag army. Push on, men, push on.
5300266	This is a suitable fighting force.
5300267	Our numbers are increased. We grow ready for our ultimate goal.
5300268	We grow! We are strong! The time comes for us to strike! 
5300269	We have rescued many. The time approaches, when we must fly forward and strike!
5300270	Now dats wot I call some good fightin’ Orks. We could smash some stuff up, wif all dem boyz.
5300271	We grow from a team into a cadre. It is well. Soon will be the time to move forward.
5300272	We… are… many… Good…
5300273	Techpriests! Excellent! Quickly, we must build a forward base!
5300274	We have Servitors. Construct a Stronghold. On the double!
5300275	Praise the Emperor – Servitors! We must erect a forward camp. With speed!
5300276	My minions! Worms! Build our camp, or you will wish you were back in that cage!
5300277	Ah! My Bonesingers! I am so glad to find you here. Quickly, we must summon a forward camp, if we hope to defeat your captors.
5300278	Wotz this? Grots! Get outta dat cage and build us some stuffs to fight wif. Nooow!
5300279	Although they have killed our Earth Caste engineers, their Construction Drones remain intact. We must use them to build our forward base.
5300280	Build… me… a… monolith… here… 
5300281	Lord Tahril! Enemies have infiltrated, by way of the torture gardens.
5300282	How was this allowed to happen?
5300283	I – I don’t know, Archon! They killed the guards. They amassed a force and will soon have a war-camp established.
5300284	I see. I will inform Lord Vect. Have the Soul Cages readied. They shall taste the full fury of our powers!
5300285	Lord Vect is here? On Lacunae?
5300286	Yes. Now go! The Soul Cages!
5300287	And what is this? A little insurrection? Swift death is too good for such miserable wretches as these.
5300288	So that’s their general, there. If we can strike him down, they’ll scatter. We’ll have this battle won.
5300289	Ah! Their commander takes the field. If I am not mistaken… Space Marines! That command craft is your new target it. Take it down, and the field is ours.
5300290	Sisters, mark well the enemy commander. It is he who must be smitten, in the Emperor’s name!
5300291	He – he will pay. I will kill him myself! His army shall fall and scatter, and I shall wear his skull as a trophy!
5300292	The one known as… Vect. It is he whom we must destroy.
5300293	Dat one – ‘e’s da Warboss, sure. We get ‘im, we got ‘em licked, is wot I say. An’ wot I say, you do!
5300294	Surely that must be the command craft, leading their unruly mobs. If we were to strike it down, would not their soldiers scatter, devoid of all discipline or courage?
5300295	He… must… die…
5300296	What? One of our Soul Cages, destroyed? They will pay!
5300297	Another Soul Cage? Miserable scum! If you do not guard the last cage with your very lives, I will teach you new meanings of the word, "pain"!
5300298	All our Soul Cages? Gone? I am displeased, Tahril. Heads shall roll! Perhaps yours. 
5300299	They have somehow managed to destroy our soul cages. Quickly, we must fall back to defensive positions.
5300300	I shall feast upon your entrails!
5300301	My Dais will crush you, wretched worms!
5300302	Your end approaches. It is me.
5300303	Back! Back!
5300304	Retreat! I require repairs!
5300305	My Dais is damaged. But I shall return!
5300306	Take me back, you fools. We need more firepower.
5300307	That is but a taste of the pain to come!
5300308	Now they shall pay handsomely for their impudence!
5300309	Are you sniveling fools, or Dark Eldar Warriors? Go – go and kill many before you are killed…Or I will kill you now!
5300310	Tahril, I did not come to this moon to be trapped and shot at by impudent slaves. Beat them back, and slaughter everyone one of them!
5300311	We must find the intruders, and quickly.
5300312	We are under attack. Quickly, alert Commander Or’es’Ka.
5300313	Our communications tower is not yet operational.
5300314	Get it working, warrior, and with great speed.
5300315	Relay, this is General Stubbs. The area’s cleared. You have a gift for us?
5300316	Wrapped in ribbons. We’re ready to deploy. 
5300317	Excellent work, soldiers. We’ve got to assemble this base-camp, and quickly. I don’t think these xenos are gonna wait for us to come knocking.
5300318	This Force Commander Boreale to Central. Area is secured. Deploy Field Command.
5300319	We copy. Drop ships… deployed.
5300320	Space Marines, put together this base and get ready to show those xenos what we're made of.
5300321	Excellent, the area has been cleared.
5300322	Sisters, hear me. Make ready for war. Do so with haste. We must not tarry from our holy purpose.
5300323	Great God Khorne, the blood spilled here is your blood. Give us our Stronghold, give us our strength… grant us victory!
5300324	Do you see? Do you see? Our gods hear our words! They fill us with might! They fill the foe with terror! Death shall blaze and blood shall flow!
5300325	It is well, a space has been cleared. Let us summon our forces from the Webway.
5300326	We are at your command, Farseer.
5300327	Good. We must build our army swiftly, and prepare for the strike.
5300328	A landing spot! Good. Summon a Kabal Fortress, and the slaves!
5300329	Make haste, cretins. There is much sport – and many souls – to be had, but only if our attack is swift.
5300330	Awright, now listen up boyz. We gots’d dis far. Dat’s good. Dat’s cuz we’s da Orks, and I’m Gorgutz, da one and only! No one stops Gorgutz! Now, bring in da Grotz and da Fort.
5300331	<cheers>
5300332	Dat’s wot I like ta see! Get ‘dem buildings put up, and quick like, so’s we can get down to the fightin’. 
5300333	Commander! The intruders – we cannot locate them. They must have breached where our comm relays are not yet operational.
5300334	Now… we… build…
5300335	Now… they… die…
5300336	No! They have taken the communications tower. We are unable to contact Commander Or’es’Ka.
5300337	Then we must fight, and die for the Greater Good!
5300338	Ah! We have received a communication from Periphery Base 9-3-Red. 
5300339	Have Fire Warriors and Kroot dispatched immediately. We must stop the enemy before they progress into our military complex.
5300340	Right away, Commander.
5300341	We must find the location of our security breach. Have scouts sent. Let them scour every possible breach location, and report back immediately.
5300342	They shall be sent immediately.
5300343	Commander Or’es’Ka, the intruders have been located! They breached our defenses at Periphery Base 9-3-Red.
5300344	Excellent work, warrior.
5300345	Ah! How many Pathfinders have we dispatched, and no news! Where did they last report from?
5300346	Commander, they have all been in sector 3-Red.
5300347	Then we should direct our forces there.
5300348	Commander! We are under attack! 
5300349	Then they have shown their hand! Good, we now know where to find them.
5300350	Commander Or’es’Ka,  how close to ready is this orbital defense system?
5300351	It – it will fire, but it is not calibrated, and security codes have not been installed.
5300352	Have it readied. That is sufficient to fire on the intruder.
5300353	But Wise One, it will not fire with great accuracy. Some of our own troops may –
5300354	Then they are sacrificed for the Greater Good. Do as I say, and victory is ours.
5300355	Commander – Ethereal – the orbital defense system has been activated and primed, and is now ready to fire.
5300356	Is the enemy in our sights?
5300357	Yes, Commander Or’es’Ka. But – not all cooling systems are in place, and the cannon will overheat if fired too often.
5300358	Well, fire as often as it is safe to do so. We must hold them off until our reinforcement fleet arrives.
5300359	General Stubbs – the alien “Ethereal” leader has been sighted by their space cannon. The Xeno Handbook identifies these leaders as primary targets.
5300360	Commander Boreale, the xeno leader, called an Ethereal, was been sighted by the great Space Cannon.
5300361	Good. Now we know where to aim our guns.
5300362	Canoness, our surveillance has revealed that a powerful Tau religious leader is within the compound. 
5300363	Where is he? If we kill him, we kill their faith and hope.
5300364	By the great cannon, Mistress.
5300365	Ah! I see the one they all bow to. The false god! He is food for the many mouths of Chaos! By the big gun! There. I can see him!
5300366	I see… I have seen their Farseer, who knows nothing of the future. He stands by their great cannon.
5300367	Archon! Their Ethereal, whom they serve like the groveling slaves they are. We have seen him. He is by their great cannon.
5300368	We have two reasons, then, to pay him a visit.
5300369	Warboss! Gorgutz!
5300370	Yeh, wot is it?
5300371	Me boyz saw dat Effereal ya said ta look out for.
5300372	Well where iz ‘e?
5300373	By da big big gun dey got down dere. 
5300374	I see … their Lord … kill …  him…
5300375	Commander, they have taken control of the base defense guns!
5300376	Commander, the defense systems are under our control!
5300377	Lieutenant, do have have a confirmed kill on the Ethereal?
5300378	We… no sir, no body has been identified.
5300379	You, Marine, did we get the Ethereal?
5300380	No, Commander Boreale. He vanished… I don’t know how.
5300381	Sisters, do we have the body of the xeno leader?
5300382	No, Canoness. We have looked, we could not find the Ethereal’s body.
5300383	Where did he go? Where!? Hrrrgh…. find him!
5300384	Councilor, tell me. Have we slain this Ethereal of theirs?
5300385	Alas, Farseer, I cannot say that we have. He seems somehow to have vanished. 
5300386	What? How did this ‘Ethereal’ slip from our clutches? We, old of years and keen of sight! When we get him, I myself shall strip the flesh from his living corpse!
5300387	Did we get da Effereal?
5300388	Er, no Warboss. I donno where ‘e got to.
5300389	‘Ow’d you lose ‘im? Ya sotted grotty excuse for an Ork!
5300390	Ethereal … has … escaped us…
5300391	General Stubbs, we have sighted the Ethereal again. He was seen in their central command, entering their Coalition Center building.
5300392	Commander Boreale, it appears the Ethereal did escape. He was seen entering the Coalition Center in the Tau central command.
5300393	Canoness, we have found the xeno leader. The Ethereal somehow made it safely to the Tau central command.
5300394	Ah, there is that cursed Ethereal! Wretched stripling! I will burn down your buildings! I will cast you out of that tall spire, to your death! To your death!
5300395	Farseer, we have seen Tau Ethereal. He somehow escaped to their central command, and has taken refuge in their Coalition Center.
5300396	Aha! I have underestimated this Ethereal. Look, he somehow got himself to the safety of their central command. I will take great joy in showing him his own entrails…
5300397	Dere he is! Dere’s da grayskin Effereal. How’d he get all da way over dere?
5300398	I … see … you … Ethereal…
5300399	The speed with which we crush you will be certain proof of Tau superiority.
5300400	Fools – the allies of the Greater Good shall always prevail.
5300401	How is it that they are so strong? If we had only finished construction, Nan Yanoi would have been unassailable!
5300402	They have reached the central command! We must fight to protect our Ethereal!
5300403	Do us proud, 55th .
5300404	Get ‘em, boyz. Smash ‘em good! Show ‘em Orkz is da best!
5300405	Now we seez if youz boyz is worth ta be called Orks.
5300406	Get in place, m’boyz. Fight, an’ fight good. Oi! Da Killy Spot is ours. Ours!
5300407	Aaaagh! Dey gotz demselves da Killy Spot!
5300408	Wotz so speshul ‘bout dis Killy Spot o’ yours? Jus’ take it back.
5300409	You try gettin’ it back!
5300410	You wotch yer mouf dere, ya pimply grot.
5300411	Nobz. Such large Orks are a threat. We should remove their camp, if we can reach it.
5300412	Ork Nobz! Look sharp, men. They must have a camp somewhere. If we come to them, they will not be coming to us. 
5300413	Do you see these Ork Nobz, Sisters? Remove their camp, and we have taken a threat off the field of battle.
5300414	Ork Nobz! Kill their camp – stop them at their source.
5300415	The Nob strain of Ork has been sighted. We would do well to destroy their place of origin.
5300416	There are Ork Nobz sent against us. Strike not the arm, but the heart, you worthless curs!
5300417	Ork Nobz have been sighted. We should find their camp, and remove this obstacle from our path.
5300418	Nobz… find camp… destroy.
5300419	They have tanks. This is a direct threat to our operations. Find and destroy those Mek Shops.
5300420	Ork tanks. Find their machine shops and put a stop to those contraptions.
5300421	The Orks have tanks. In the name of the Emperor, purge this land of their factories.
5300422	Send tanks against us? Against Chaos? You will pay! We will crush your puny little Mek Shops! Crush them!
5300423	They think to fight us with tanks? If we remove their Mek Shops, then they shall not.
5300424	Tanks, is it? The cursed beasts. Let us melt their factories, and feast on their mechanics.
5300425	The enemy fights with armored vehicles. Disable their means of production, and they will have none.
5300426	Find… and destroy… Mek Shops… stop tanks.
5300427	We cannot have more of those things on the battlefield. We should find where-ever they’re keeping them and kill them before they come after us. 
5300428	We can take anything they throw at us. But it would be less of a nuisance if we did not have these giant beasts on the field, slowing our progress.
5300429	Sisters, find the source of these abominations and leave it a smoking pile of ash!
5300430	That beast was huge. I say, kill it in its cage, rather than in the open!
5300431	If they have more such giant beasts, I had fain not fight them. We should find and destroy the places where they are kept.
5300432	Faugh! I hope never to fight such a thing again. Let us slay them in their pens, before they Orks release more of them.
5300433	With a well-aimed arrow, the great hunter need not fight such a beast. Let us draw our bow at the source of these behemoths.
5300434	Let… there… be… no more… Squiggoths.
5300435	Never get in ‘ere, you sez.
5300436	You’ll see. Da Rokclaw boyz’ll stomp ‘em good.
5300437	‘Zat so?
5300438	We got tricks we ain’t showed yet, we do. You just wotch us.
5300439	Dey’d better wotchout now! We’s da Orks! Da Rokclaw Orks!
5300440	<give out a shout>
5300441	Gaah! Oi’ve stepped on grots as fought better ‘an you sorry Orks. 
5300442	<whimpers>
5300443	A giant Waaagh! Banner. Hmm… wonder what happens if we torch it. 
5300444	That giant banner they have there. Knock it down – that will demoralize them.
5300445	They have erected a giant pennant of their wretched excuse for a faith. Sisters, we must cast it down!
5300446	That banner there – tear it down!
5300447	You see they bolster morale with that giant banner, there. Strike it down, and we strike at their heart.
5300448	What do you think they’d do if we just happened to– blast their giant banner into little pieces?
5300449	They draw their fortitude from the great banner upon the heights. Destroy it, and our battle is half won.
5300450	The banner… destroy it…
5300451	Waaaah!
5300452	My Waaagh! Banner. Dey gotz my Waaagh! Banner! Why I’ll…
5300453	Dey’re in da main base!
5300454	I’ve ‘ad enuf a youz. Now MY boyz’ll show you ‘ow it’s done.
5300455	This oughta make 'em blasty!
5300456	More sluggaz! More sluggaz! More! More!
5300457	Oi! Dem's my speshul guard boyz!
5300458	Oooooh! They keep squashin' everything they get to!
5300459	Get 'em! Waaagh!!!
5300460	Commander Stubbs! Four monoliths have been sighted. It – it looks as though they’re being powered up.
5300461	We’ll have to put a stop to that. We can’t have four of those things bearing down on us. There must be some way to cut off their energy supply…
5300462	Sir! Reconnaissance had identified four monoliths at the perimeter of the target area. They – they appear to be drawing power from the center. I don’t know what for.
5300463	Excellent work. That area is supplying power that is used to upgrade their capabilities. It is mission critical that we prevent these monoliths from being fully restored. Which means… we will need to cut off their power.
5300464	Canoness. Our scouts have identified four monoliths outlying the central area. Scans indicate that they are drawing power from there, which is being used to – to awaken them.
5300465	They must be stopped. There are two strategies: cut off the flow, or smash them quickly…
5300466	Master! Lord! They have monoliths, four monoliths. They drink, drink power and they grow!
5300467	They must be stopped. There are two strategies: cut them at the jugular, or pierce them through the skull!
5300468	It is as I feared! Power… courses from the center, to four buds, four… monoliths. If these are allowed to reach full bloom, it is very likely our demise. They must be stopped, be it at the stem or at the bud. They must be stopped.
5300469	Archon, we flew above this foul city. At the four cardinal points we scried four monoliths. They seemed, Lord, to draw power from the center.
5300470	Hmph! If it is as I fear, these fortresses are being restored to fullness. If they were to reach this state, they would be fearsome foes. We must do all that we can to halt their progress.
5300471	Wot’s dis? Dem monoliffs in da corners is plugged in. If we don’t stomp ‘em, dey’ll go full up, dey’ll be worse ‘an four squigoffs stompin on us. Unplug ‘em, dat’s wot I say.
5300472	Commander, our equipment has detected a strong flow of energy from the center towards four points at the edge of their compound.
5300473	And what lies at these points?
5300474	Monoliths, commander.
5300475	Ah, this is a great threat. That power restores each monolith. When they are fully restored, they are a force to be reckoned with. They must be stopped.
5300476	Take… it… back…
5300477	It… is ours… drink again…grow… 
5300478	General, sir, scanners show that this attack came directly from a Summoning Core at the back of the city. Destroying that might prevent further teleporting.
5300479	Commander. Our scanners show that this defensive force originated at the Summoning Core at the back of the compound. Dispatching the Core should prevent similar defensive teleports.
5300480	Canoness! We have traced the energy pattern to a Summoning Core at the far end of the Necropolis. It appears that this is how they deploy these defensive forces.
5300481	Curse these teleporting fiends! Blast them to smithereens. Do you know how they do it? No?? I’ll tell you! There’s a Summoning Core, in the back of this, this city. Let us smash it with the speed of Khorne’s fist!
5300482	These defensive maneuvers originate in a single source. There is… yes, a Summoning Core behind their compound. If we can dispatch this structure, we defeat this tactic, gaining a true advantage.
5300483	Archon. I have discovered the secret of these teleportation tricks! They hail from one point – a Summoning Core nestled behind this necropolis. Destroy it, and that grievance shall trouble us no more. 
5300484	Oi! I see where da tellyporta dey usin’s at. It’s back dere. We oughta stomp that good, we ought.
5300485	Commander, sensor arrays have determined the origin of this defensive force. They all came from a Summoning Core, which it seems controls all defensive teleports.
5300486	Sir, the monoliths are gaining power.
5300487	Commander, the monoliths are powering up.
5300488	Mistress, the monoliths gain in power.
5300489	Master! Lord! The monoliths gain, they grow!
5300490	We must make haste, the monoliths gain in power.
5300491	Archon, the monoliths are gaining power. We must not tarry.
5300492	Boss! Da monoliffs, dey're powerin' up!
5300493	The monoliths are gaining power. We must not hesitate to act.
5300494	Sir, one of the monoliths is partially restored.
5300495	Commander, one of the monoliths has reached its second phase.
5300496	Mistress, a monolith is in its second stage of restoration.
5300497	Master! Now a monolith is partially restored!
5300498	Ah! A monolith has gained a new stage of restoration.
5300499	That monolith is one step closer to complete. We must halt its growth.
5300500	Uh oh, a monoliff jus' wen' up a level.
5300501	Commander, one monolith is now partially restored!
5300502	Another restored monolith. Take that thing out of commission!
5300503	It's gone active. Marines, your objective is that giant tower of death.
5300504	Cursed abomination! The tower has gone active. Sisters, it must be destroyed!
5300505	Choas! Blast that cursed monolith to smithereens!
5300506	The central monolith is now active. It is their last hope. We must finish this! Now!
5300507	Aaagh! The monolith has gone active! Destroy that thing! Blow it to pieces!
5300508	It's shootin' us! Da monoliff is shootin' us! Bash it good! Waaagh!
5300509	The central monolith – it has gone active! This is their last stand. Destroy it, and we prevail!
5300510	If we go in there now, we risk the outer monoliths being fully restored. That might be more than we could handle.
5300511	Our first priority is those four outer monoliths that are powering up. Hitting the center could lose us the battle.
5300512	Everything must be destroyed… but I fear we will overextend ourselves if we do not destroy the outer monoliths first.
5300513	Ah, leave it be! We cannot fight the outer monoliths and the center, all at once!
5300514	Attacking the center before the outer monoliths is a path fraught with great peril. It is unlikely to succeed.
5300515	Tis a bad prospect, trying to take the center before we have demolished the outer structures.
5300516	Wotchyou doin'? First we smash da outta monaliffs, then the middle one! 'Ear that?
5300517	It would be unwise to maintain an assault on both the outer and inner fortresses of the enemy. And the outside is a much greater threat.
5300518	Death… blooms… and flies… out… to kill…
5300519	It is complete… now… you will die…
5300520	Awaken!... awaken… and… destroy!
5300521	It is… restored… now… it will… vanquish!
5300522	You… shall not… go here.
5300523	Die… trespassers…
5300524	Go… back!...
5300525	Enter… the spider’s… web…
5300526	Embrace… death… you… cannot… escape it…
5300527	You think… you… have won… you… have not…
5300528	…
5300529	Great Deceiver… lead them… to… their… deaths…
5300530	We've uncovered the source of their air units. Hit it with all you've got, men.
5300531	Commander! We've located the production facilities for the Hell Talons. Awaiting your orders to destroy them!
5300532	The enemy's Hell Talon factories. We must destroy them!
5300533	There are the Hell Talon production facilities. Destroy those, and the air will be ours alone.
5300534	Ah! We have found the source of these Hell Talons. Burn it down!
5300535	Dat's where all da fightas is comin' from. Let's blast it up good.
5300536	The Hell Talon production compound. We should destroy it.
5300537	Destroy… air factories…
5300538	It is not over till the last Space Marine drops his gun and falls.
5300539	This is going to be easy. They will not see us coming.
5300540	Blood Ravens! To arms!
5300541	Lightning fighters! If we don't take out production facilities, they'll shoot everything we've got out of the air.
5300542	They have Lightning aircraft. I know those fighters well. We had better take out their production facilities. 
5300543	Fighter planes. Well… we can't have those interfering. Best to find and level their production facilities.
5300544	If we don't destroy their factories, those planes will control the skies!
5300545	Air power… burn the nest and see if they keep flying about our heads!
5300546	Fightas, is it, then? Boyz, if you see where dem fightas is comin from, smash it good! 
5300547	It would be advantageous to remove their capacity for fighter jets. Surely they must have production facilities nearby.
5300548	Find… air factories… destroy them…
5300549	We have to stop those Tempests. Find where they're coming from, and destroy it.
5300550	Sisters, we must disable their ability to produce aircraft.
5300551	I want their aircraft shot out of the sky, and their factories blown to pieces.
5300552	We must find the origin of their aircraft, and destroy it.
5300553	I do not like these planes flying at us. Find their production facilities, and destroy them.
5300554	Gork stomp dose flyin' humies! We gotsta find where dey's comin' from and shoot 'em fulla holes!
5300555	Fire Warriors, it would serve us well to find their air factories and put a stop to these Tempest attacks.
5300556	Stop .. flying … things…
5300557	We'lll never make it through with those Fighter-Bombers harassing us. We' need to find out where they're coming from, and destroy it.
5300558	I do not want my Space Marines to just trying to march through all those Fighter-Bombers. Identify their point of origin, and neutralize it.
5300559	These Fighter-Bombers have made this passage too hazardous. Wherever they are coming from must be burnt to the ground.
5300560	A curse upon these bombers! They are too lethal. Whereever they're coming from, I want it destroyed!
5300561	No! Hold back, warriors. We must cut these bombers off at the source, or they will be our undoing.
5300562	Look sharp! The pass is filled with Fighter-Bombers. We must put a stop to their production, before we venture that way.
5300563	Commander! The pass ahead is well defended by Fighter-Bombers. We would do well to stop their production, before proceeding.
5300564	Stop … the … bombers…
5300565	Guardsmen, look sharp! That Chaos Field is still active. Go in there, and you're not coming out again.
5300566	Space Marines, steer clear of their central base until we've taken out that Chaos Field.
5300567	Be wary, Sisters! The Chaos Field around their central compound is strong. Enter it, and you will surely perish.
5300568	Do not go near the Chaos Field! It is certain death! We must find a way to bring the field down, first.
5300569	Stay away from there! The energies in that central base will kill you, fools. I'll tell you when the time is right.
5300570	Get outta there, ya snivvelin grots. D'ya want yer head blowed up? We gotta get that field down, then smash 'em up.
5300571	We must keep our distance from their central compound. Dangerous energies protect it now, and it is certain death to enter.
5300572	Not… yet…
5300573	Avaunt, infidels!
5300574	Avaunt!
5300575	Your guns are nothing in my presence.
5300576	Arrr. Dey's comin' dis way! Send da Bombaz! Send da Nobz! Send da tanks! Bring all da Squiggoffs! Waaagh!
5300577	They… shall not… have it…
5300578	Commander, we have identified small Necron encampments South and Northwest of our base. They could do some damage, if we left it unguarded.
5300579	Commander, scouts have located small Necron outposts at the South and Northwest. They have got sufficient strength to threaten our base.
5300580	Canoness, Missionaries have spied small Necron posts South and Northwest of our base of operations. They are not strong, but if our base were left unattended…
5300581	Dreaded Lord! There are small Necron camps South and Northwest of our base. Do you wish us to destroy these nuisances?
5300582	Farseer, small outposts have been spotted South and Northwest of our Webway Assembly. While they stand, we should not leave our base unguarded.
5300583	Bah! Petty Necron outposts flank our camp to the South and Northwest. …shall we guard our base, or crush these pests?
5300584	Boss! Boss! Dey's more of 'em! Souf and Norfwest. Ain't very big, tho!
5300585	Commander! Small Necron outposts have been identified to the South and Northwest of our base. They could do some damage, if we left ourselves undefended
5300586	They think themselves mighty. But our devotion grants us strength beyond the scope of mortal arms!
5300587	Fire! Fire, my sisters! Do not falter, do not blink until the enemy are cinders, cinders and ash!
5300588	And lo! Those who stand against the Emperor’s will shall ever falter; and they shall ever fail. By His Faithful they shall be crushed, they shall be burned, and surely cast into the pits of horrid void.
5300589	Know that we shall never surrender. Every Sister, to the last, would rather die a holy martyr, in a field of flame, than lay down her arms.
5300590	Exalted and luminous Saint. I beg you, fight by our side.
5300591	Together we will fight,and by the Emperor's will, we will triumph.
5300592	There are the Lightning fighter factories. Level them, men. Quickly!
5300593	The Sisters' air factories! Destroy it. Now!
5300594	Destroy… the air factories… 
5300595	The Lightning fighter production facilities. There it is! Quickly, lay waste to it, for Chaos!
5300596	See, there are the air production facilities. Quickly, it must be destroyed.
5300597	Ah! Their lightning production facilities. Destroy it!
5300598	Dat's where da fightas is. Wreck it, for da Orks!
5300599	Ah! We have found their air factories. We should make haste to decommission them.
5300600	The Adepta Sororitas Manufactorums! Let's see if we can take it out.
5300601	Look, the Sisters of Battle Manufactorums. We can put a stop to these Exorcist Tanks once and for all.
5300602	Destroy… Manufactorums…
5300603	The Manufactorums! Knock them down!
5300604	That is where their Exorcist Tanks are produced. Turn it to smoke and ash.
5300605	Haha! The enemy's Manufactorums. Not for long…
5300606	Now we found the da Mannifaktorimz, all we gots ta do is smash it.
5300607	The enemy Manufactorums! Let us put a dent in their production.
5300608	Mines! By the Emperor, look out for the mines!
5300609	Sisters, be wary! There are mines underfoot!
5300610	Mines! Look out! Mines!
5300611	Tread lightly! They have planted mines here!
5300612	Gah! There are mines here. That's the sort of trick I would play.
5300613	Wotchout! Dey're mines 'ere!
5300614	Caution, Fire Warriors! They seek to trick us with mines!
5300615	Mines…
5300616	Sir, we are blind down there, there are only a couple beacons left.
5300617	Throw what we've got at them. We just need to keep them disoriented.
5300618	Yes sir.
5300619	Defend the air field!
5300620	So this is where the Rhinos were coming from.
5300621	Ah… this is where their Rhino Transports come from.
5300622	Master! Look, that's where the Rhino Transports are coming from.
5300623	Farseer, surely this is where all their transports have been coming from.
5300624	The source of all those armored transports. We have found it.
5300625	Ahaha! We found da shops dey makin' da transports from.
5300626	Commander, this must be the source of all the Rhino tanks.
5300627	Found … them…
5300628	The Imperial Guard approaches. Space Marines, make ready. This is it.
5300629	The Sisters of Battle approach. Ready yourself, Blood Ravens.
5300630	Blood Ravens! The foul traitors approach. Now they learn what the true and faithful are made of.
5300631	The Eldar army approaches. Ready yourself, Blood Ravens.
5300632	The wretched Dark Eldar draw near. Ready yourself, Blood Ravens.
5300633	Greenskins are entering our base. Ready yourself, Blood Ravens.
5300634	The Tau army approaches. Ready yourself, Blood Ravens.
5300635	The Necrons approach. Ready yourself, Blood Ravens.
5300636	Deep strike, deploy! Deploy! Send everything you have got! Do you read me? Everything you've got!
5300637	Fools… you have… released… more… power…
5300638	More… power! … they … must … die!
5300639	All … energy … go… I … command it ..
5300640	…
5300641	Die.
5300642	Take… it… back…
5300643	Need… power… get… power!
5300644	Power… slipping…
5300645	Sir, we’ve determined that power is flowing to each of the outer monoliths at a point just outside the center. If we can take those points, General, we can stop the flow of power.
5300646	Commander, sensors have identified power flow from the central base to the four outer monoliths. There is a point at each path, just outside the center. If we hold it, we can turn the power off.
5300647	Mistress, we have identified four points outside the central base. Each is provides power to one of the outer monoliths. If we took those points, we could stop them from powering up.
5300648	Word Bearers Legion, we've seen four points just outside the center. Each point provides power to one of the outer monoliths. Take these points, and we control the power. We stop the monoliths.
5300649	Farseer, we have located four points just outside the central Necron base. Each is a gate that provides power to one of the outer monoliths. We can stop the flow of power by taking these points.
5300650	Warriors! Listen to me. There are four points, just outside the central Necron base. It is through these that the outer monoliths are being powered. If we are to halt the restoration of the monoliths, we must take these points!
5300651	Boss!  Boss! Da Mek Boyz figgered it out. See, dey's four points near the middle, right? Dat's how da power gets to da outer monoliffs. All we gotta do is take dem, and da monoliffs stop!
5300652	Commander, our sensors have identified four critical locations just outside the central Necron base. Each of these channels power to the outer monoliths. If we take these points, we can stop those monoliths from being powered up.
5300669	Sir, our scouts have spotted a base not far off, in the direction that this attack came from.
5300670	Commander, our reconnaissance has identified a small military encampment in the direction of the attack.
5300671	Lord! Lord! We have seen, seen a Loyalist camp. It is near! It is from there they attacked us.
5300672	There is… a small warcamp. Very near here. We should look for it in the direction of their last assault.
5300673	Archon Tahril! Our Mandrakes have spied a camp, not far from here… they said it was in the direction of that last attack.
5300674	Warboss! Me an’ some boyz saw where da burny-humies came from. Dey’s a base, an’ it’s real close. Let’s stomp it!
5300675	Commander, the attack originated in a camp extremely close to our own location. Perhaps that should be our first target?
5300676	They came… from nearby… crush them… there…
5300677	Our piety leads us to battle. Gather the crusade, we march to victory!
5300678	To the crusade, and death to the enemy!
5300679	Full of faith, we march! From Convent to Convent, our numbers grow, and so our might!
5300680	This place is sacred. You shall not set foot here, in the Emperor’s name!
5300681	Your blasphemy is annulled!
5300682	Sisters, our foes have shattered two of the shrines. We must defend the remaining two, to our last pious breaths!
5300683	The shrines… in ruins… 
5300684	My Shrines… in ruins! Woe unto us!
5300685	We are forsaken… is all lost? And yet, we must fight. Sisters, we must fight, and go in glory!
5300686	Alright, men. We need to make a beachhead, and fast. First, we need to break through these outer defenses.
5300687	Blood Ravens! Our objective is to establish a foothold. We will have to blast through these perimeter defenses, and quickly. 
5300688	Sisters, our aim is to breach these outer defenses with all due haste. From there we must establish a beachhead, from which to launch our attack.
5300689	Listen to me, Word Bearers Legion. First, we blast through the outer defenses, here. Then we must establish a base camp. We move quickly. Attaaack!
5300690	We must prepare to move with deadly speed and accuracy. It is critical that we break through the outer defenses and establish a foothold within the Tau base, before they can pinpoint our location.
5300691	Listen to me, you dogs. We must move as a single, lethal blade. We must cut through the defenses ahead of us, and then, as swift as lightning, clear a foothold for ourselves. Do you understand? Do you? Good. Then we go.
5300692	Lissen up 'ere. Dis 'ere's da plan. We move, fast, see? We knock through 'em all fast, till we're inside. Then we build a camp. Got it? Good. 
5300693	Go... in... there...
5300694	We are under attack! Fire Warriors, hold your ground! We must hold them back for as long as possible!
5300695	The strength of this surprise attack is worrying to me, Commander. Tell me, when can we expect the fleet of reinforcements that followed my own ship?
5300696	Wise One, as you know, the Warp Storm has made our normal navigation equipment useless. The fleet is guided by three beacons within Nan Yanoi. As long as all three signals operate, it should not be long.
5300697	This is well. I fear we may yet need these extra troops.
5300698	Orbital Defenses ready to fire.
5300699	They are attempting to seize the Orbital Defense controls! We must stop them at all costs!
5300700	Commander, they have taken control of the Orbital Defense System. They use our defenses against us.
5300701	It must be retaken. See to it.
5300702	We have reclaimed the orbital defenses!
5300703	No! They have taken back the defensive cannon!
5300704	They have destroyed one of the guidance beacons!
5300705	Ah... this is unfortunate. Still, on the strength of two guidance signals, our fleet will not be greatly delayed.
5300706	Commander! Another guidance beacon was destroyed!
5300707	This is a great setback. To follow a single guidance beacon will be exceedingly difficult. We cannot expect the fleet any time soon.
5300708	All three guidance beacons taken out. Commander, is all hope lost?
5300709	We will receive no reinforcements. Without a signal, the fleet must turn back. We must defeat the enemy as we are.
5300710	Excellent news, Ethereal. Our fleet will not be long.
5300711	It is exceedingly good fortune. We have only to hold out until then.
5300712	Commander, the fleet has arrived!
5300713	All soldiers are armed and ready for combat.
5300714	Excellent, my advanced orders were received. Come, it is time to drive these intruders off of Nan Yanoi.
5300715	Air Caste! The enemy is close upon us. We require your assistance. This is our last chance. Strike at the coordinates I give you, and do not hold fire for any reason.
5300716	Coordinates received. We will commence at once!
5300717	They have been allowed to get far too close to us. Use all the powers of our Soul Cages against them. I command it.
5300718	Yes, Lord Vect. It is better to use those souls, and annihilate these – these upstarts.
5300719	Then go - and see to it that you do not fail.
5300720	You thought you could elude us?
5300721	You cannot hide here. We see all, and you will die by our hands.
5300722	Sneaking? I think not.
5300723	We wield powers you cannot even imagine.
5300724	The time of your suffering is about to begin!
5300725	See how you like us... now!
5300726	Entering Alert Level Five.
5300727	Eastern Annex to Central Command. Baneblade convoy has been dispatched and is currently en route.
5300728	With the enemy in the area, I want those convoys well guarded. Safe delivery of those convoys is critical!
5300729	General, another convoy shipment's arrived.
5300730	Excellent!
5300731	The enemy seems to have learned the routes that are convoys are taking. I know! Order two convoys dispatched at the same time. They can't be everywhere at once!
5300732	Someone tell me why we don't have a Baneblade out in the field, yet?
5300733	Sir, none are fully operational. We have about half the number of convoy shipments required.
5300734	General, one Baneblade is fully prepared and combat-ready.
5300735	At last! Get it onto the field as soon as possible. Keep the convoys coming. We'll take as much firepower as we can against these bastards.
5300736	General, we have a Baneblade ready for combat.
5300737	Finally! Its orders are to engage immediately.
5300738	Our Mars Pattern buildings! Well… the convoys are useless to us now.
5300739	They've thrown a wrench in our Baneblade production… We're just going to have to do without them! If they think that's all we've got up our sleeves… Officer, we fight unto the last, do you understand me?
5300740	Yes, sir.
5300741	Any soldier caught abandoning his post is to be shot without further questioning. We can still win this!
5300742	To arms! To arms, men! They're attacking the Basilisk Magnus! Defend it with your lives!
5300743	Curse these fiends! They've taken out our Basilisk Magnus!
5300744	All our artillery spotters were killed? How can that be?
5300745	Get Marauder Bomber production up and running. We need to hit them with everything we've got.
5300746	Marauder production orders confirmed, Sir. Our bombers are closing in for close-range assault maneuvers.
5300747	General, our Marauder production facility is being attacked!
5300748	Put some firepower on it. Drive them back!
5300749	Valkyrie drop commencing.
5300750	Good! Good!
5300751	Prepare for Valkyrie Transport landing...
5300752	Valkyrie, incoming.
5300753	Heh heh. I see ya now.
5300754	Look here. They're tryin' to sneak past us.
5300755	Sneaky little... Tryin' to use stealth on the Imperial Guard!
5300756	Can any of these inactive Baneblades run at all?
5300757	Somewhat, General, but they – 
5300758	I don't care. Put men in them. They can least fire... some of the guns!
5300759	You can't outgun the Imperial Guard.
5300760	252nd Conservator Regiment, for the glory of the Imperium!
5300761	Fight for all you're worth, soldiers! We've got to win this!
5300762	Get building immediately. I've suddenly got a feeling this won't be easy…
5300763	Work quickly and prepare to mobilize. We do not know what is ahead of us.
5300764	Commence immediately. We must now be prepared for the most arduous struggle.
5300765	So, our Nightwing production has been destroyed. I see our many roads to victory growing fewer and more arduous. Yet, there is still hope.
5300766	The elite Shining Eagle squadron of Nightwings remain where they were assigned, Farseer.
5300767	Good. We must press on.
5300768	Weary of firing at shadows and illusions? We will always elude you. Leave now, while you can.
5300769	Another illusion barrier was destroyed, Farseer.
5300770	I see… We shall prepare for the worst.
5300771	Then the other ones must not fall…
5300772	Let us see how they deal with the Shining Eagles. They are no ordinary pilots.
5300773	Even our Shining Eagle Squadron could not stop them!
5300774	Farseer, we have lost our Ranger and Warp Spider facilities.
5300775	Their noble deaths will be honored. Only victory matters now.
5300776	Watch out for those patrols
5300777	Look sharp, Marines. Patrols are in the area.
5300778	Caution, Sisters. I see guard patrols.
5300779	Guard patrols! We should avoid detection… for now.
5300780	We must be wary of these guard patrols.
5300781	Wotchout, boyz, da guards is on patrol.
5300782	Guards on patrol. Move with caution, warriors.
5300783	Caution… guards…
5300784	Spotter ready.
5300785	Sir, our scanners show there are only two beacons left.
5300786	Canoness, scanners indicate only two beacons remaining.
5300787	Not more than two beacons remain. We must destroy them. They will be heavily defended, I do not doubt it.
5300788	There cannot be more than a couple beacons remaining. Yes… I can sense them.
5300789	Archon, only two beacons remain. How hard can it be to destroy two more?
5300790	At's all but two of 'em, Boss. We smash 'em and no more 'umies outta da sky.
5300791	Commander, our sensors show that only two beacons remain. We close in on victory!
5300792	Only… two… left…
5300793	The target is in view. Fire Hunter Seeker missile… now.
5300794	I want the commanders taken out of combat. Dispatch the assassins. Immediately.
5300795	General, our Marauder factories have been destroyed! They've taken out our air support!

5400017	Select your Servitor and build a Plasma Generator.
5400018	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Ecclesiarchal Chapel.
5400021	Select your Ecclesiarchal Servitor and build an Adepta Sororitas Convent.
5400022	The Convent is the structure where you build most Sisters of Battle's infantry units, as well as their commander unit, the Canoness.  
5400023	Excellent, the Adepta Sororitas Convent is finished.
5400026	Select your Adepta Sororitas Convent and build a Battle Sister Squad.
5400027	These fierce troops are the basic infantry of the Sisters of Battle. Although not as durable as their Space Marine allies, they are versatile and equipped with a variety of abilities and weapons that let them handle nearly any task.
5400028	Excellent. You have built a Battle Sister Squad.
5400031	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.  Select a Battle Sister Squad. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
5400032	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a Sister falls to the enemy.
5400033	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Battle Sister Squad.
5400034	Each Holy Icon also increases the maximum number of squads and vehicles you can build. There is always a maximum Squad and Vehicle Cap beyond which you cannot go.
5400035	Faith is a third resource type that is unique to the Sisters of Battle. Your current level of Faith is displayed slightly below your Requisition and Power resources.
5400036	Faith is used for special abilities called Acts of Faith. These are much more powerful than normal abilities, and can easily turn the tide of a battle.  Use them wisely.
5400037	The primary method of generating Faith is by creating Faithful units.
5400038	Faith can also be gained by using Missionaries to worship at Listening Posts. 
5400041	Select your Missionary Squad and right-click on a Listening Post.
5400042	Excellent. The Missionaries are now busy worshipping the God-Emperor, increasing your Faith. Be careful, though - while in this mode, they cannot fight, and won't even defend themselves if attacked.
5400043	Another method of gathering Faith is by building Faithful units.
5400044	One Faithful unit is the Canoness, the primary hero of the Sisters of Battle. 
5400047	Select the Adepta Sororitas Convent and build a Canoness now.
5400048	Burning with righteous vengeance, the Canoness lays waste to her enemies with powerful special abilities and punishing melee attacks.
5400049	Congratulations! You have finished building the Canoness. Your Faith resource will now increase at a faster rate.
5400052	Select your Ecclesiarchal Servitor and build a Pristine Sanctuary now.
5400053	You must build a Pristine Sanctuary in order to access weapon upgrades. Squads can be equipped with a variety of weaponry, allowing you to prepare them against different enemy types.
5400054	Excellent, the Pristine Sanctuary is complete.
5400057	The Pristine Sanctuary unlocks access to heavy weaponry for your infantry squads. Upgrade a Battle Sister Squad with Flamers.
5400058	Select your Battle Sister Squad and click the Upgrade: Flamer icon to upgrade a squad member.
5400059	Notice that a Flamer appears in one of your squad member's hands. This procedure can be performed with any of the available weapon upgrades.
5400060	Initially you can only upgrade a few units of each squad with heavy weapons. By doing further research at the Pristine Sanctuary you can unlock the capability to upgrade more.
5400061	Excellent. You have upgraded your Battle Sister Squad. You can upgrade your squads anywhere on the battlefield to weapons that are well suited to counter your enemy.
5400064	It is time to upgrade the Ecclesiarchal Chapel, your headquarters. By researching the Ecclesiarchal Cathedral upgrade, you will gain access to a whole new array of weaponry, units, and powers.
5400065	Select the Chapel and click the Upgrade to Ecclesiarchal Cathedral icon.
5400066	Some squads, like Battle Sister Squads, can add a Leader. Leaders are highly skilled warriors that can be added to some Sisters of Battle squads. You will need strong leaders if you are to defeat your enemies.
5400069	Select a Battle Sister Squad and click the Add Leader: Veteran Superior icon.
5400070	Veteran Superiors are valiant leaders that greatly increase your squad's capabilities.
5400071	Excellent! Your Veteran Superior has arrived. Note that your Leaders are part of the squad and cannot leave it.
5400072	Make sure to use your Ecclesiarchal Servitor to build Listening Posts on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
5400075	Select your Ecclesiarchal Servitor and build a Manufactorum.
5400076	Just like the Convent is used to build infantry units, the Manufactorum is used to build vehicles.
5400077	Excellent! You now have a Manufactorum. All Sisters of Battle vehicles come from this building.
5400078	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap.
5400079	Once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can increase your Vehicle Cap by researching the appropriate upgrade at your Ecclesiarchal Chapel, just like Squad Cap.
5400080	Select your Manufactorum and build an Immolator tank.
5400081	Immolators are brutal war machines that purge their enemies with white hot flames. 
5400082	Additionally, Immolators have holding space for infantry squads, which can operate the Immolator's internal weapon systems to fire at enemies outside.
5400083	Excellent! Your Immolator is now ready for battle.
5400084	Use infantry squads to capture Strategic Points and Servitors to build Listening Posts on them.
5400085	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure to build Holy Icons on your Listening Posts, in order to upgrade your Squad Cap, Vehicle Cap, and maximum Faith.
5400088	To select a unit or structure, simply click on it with the left mouse button. Go to your base and select the Kabal Fortress.
5400089	Select your Kabal Fortress and look for the Mandrake Squad icon located in the lower-right corner of the screen. Click this button now.
5400092	Excellent! You now have a Mandrake Squad. 
5400094	Order the Mandrake Squad to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
5400097	Select your Kabal Fortress and build a Tortured Slave.
5400098	Tortured Slaves are required to build additional structures.  Tortured Slaves are always available from the Kabal Fortress.
5400099	The Tortured Slave has arrived! Tortured Slaves are the Dark Eldar's builder unit. Any time you wish to build a new structure, you must use a Tortured Slave.
5400102	Select the Tortured Slave and click on the Build icon in the lower right area of the screen. This brings up the icons of all the structures the Slave can construct. Click on the Tower of Loathing icon and place it on the captured Strategic Point.
5400103	The Tower of Loathing fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
5400104	Note that, unlike other races, the Dark Eldar structures will build themselves once construction is begun.  Move your Tortured Slave away from the building and observe as progress continues.
5400105	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Towers of Loathing on all your captured Strategic Points.
5400107	Select your Tortured Slave and build a Plasma Generator.
5400108	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Kabal Fortress.
5400111	Select your Tortured Slave and build a Hall of Blood.
5400112	The Hall of Blood is the structure where you can build most Dark Eldar infantry units, as well as the Dark Eldar commander unit, the Archon.  
5400113	Excellent, the Hall of Blood is finished.
5400116	Select your Hall of Blood and build a Warrior Squad.
5400117	Warriors are the basic infantry of the Dark Eldar. Like most Dark Eldar units, they have exceptional firepower and mobility, but are very fragile. 
5400118	Excellent. You have built a Warrior Squad.
5400121	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.  Select a Warrior Squad. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
5400122	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a Warrior falls to the enemy.
5400123	Congratulations! You have reinforced your Warrior Squad.
5400124	You can increase your Squad Cap by building Slave Chambers, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
5400127	Select a Tortured Slave and build 3 Slave Chambers.  Remember: the Tortured Slave can freely move away from a structure once it has begun and it will complete itself.
5400128	Dark Eldar society is greatly dependent on the labor of slaves. As such, they rely on Slave Chambers to enhance their army.  Slave Chambers are extremely versatile and provide many benefits, expanding your Control Zone, and increasing your Squad and Vehicle Caps.
5400129	Excellent! You have completed 3 Slave Chambers.  
5400130	Slave Chambers can be customized with one of two Add-ons to provide additional benefits.
5400133	One of these Add-ons is the Torture Pit. Select a Slave Chamber and click the Torture Pit Add-on icon.
5400134	This Slave Chamber is now equipped with a Torture Pit. This will begin the torture of Slaves, producing corpses that can be used to harvest Soul Essence.
5400135	Soul Essence is a third resource type that is unique to the Dark Eldar. It can be harvested from all corpses on the battlefield, even your own. Your Soul Essence is displayed slightly below your Requisition and Power resources.
5400138	Select a Tortured Slave and click the Harvest Soul Essence icon. He will automatically walk to the nearest fresh corpse and begin harvesting the mist-like Soul Essence.
5400139	Soul Essence is used for powerful abilities that are available at all times. These abilities are located in the center of the screen, directly above the primary interface. 
5400142	Click the Corrosion icon now. Click again anywhere on the ground to target the ability. 
5400143	Excellent! Corrosion will erode your enemies' armor as long as they stay within the cloud, causing them to take more damage during battle.
5400146	Most races have a single hero they can build that can lead their entire force. The Dark Eldar call upon the Archon, a vicious melee warrior supported by elite troops known as the Incubi.
5400147	Select the Hall of Blood and build an Archon now.
5400148	The Archon is powerful in direct combat, but also can unlock a variety of special abilities to devastate the enemy.  He begins the game with Animus Vitae, which can lock enemies in place in order to leech their life essence, healing the Archon.
5400149	Congratulations! You have finished building the Archon.
5400152	Select your Archon and click the Add Incubus icon. 
5400153	Incubi are vital to keeping the relatively fragile Archon effective and alive. In addition to providing extra firepower, each Incubus added to the squad increases the duration and power of all the Archon's abilities.
5400154	Excellent. You have bolstered your squad with the addition of a powerful Incubus. To maximize effectiveness, try to keep your Archon surrounded by Incubi at all times.
5400157	Select your Tortured Slave and build a Haemonculus Laboratory now.
5400158	You must build a Haemonculus Laboratory to gain access to squad leaders and other advanced unit types.  Squad leaders are powerful units that can also often provide valuable abilities for their squad.
5400159	Additionally, there are a variety of infantry upgrades available at the Haemonculus Laboratory. You can improve your troops immensely by researching these upgrades.
5400160	Excellent, the Haemonculus Laboratory is complete. You can now add leaders to most of your infantry squads.
5400163	Select a Warrior Squad and click the Add Leader: Sybarite icon.
5400164	Sybarites are vicious leaders that are equipped with Terrorfex Grenades, which can be used to blind and demoralize the enemy.
5400165	Excellent! Your Sybarite has arrived. Note that your leaders are part of the squad and cannot leave it.
5400168	Select your Kabal Fortress and click the Planetary Raid Research icon. 
5400169	This research advances the Dark Eldar to the next technology level, granting access to more powerful infantry, vehicles, and upgrades.
5400170	Excellent, the Planetary Raid research is now complete.
5400172	Make sure to use your Tortured Slave to build Towers of Loathing on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
5400173	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Towers of Loathing upon them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
5400174	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Towers of Loathing built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
5400175	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Towers of Loathing to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
5400178	Select your Tortured Slave and build a Dark Foundry.
5400179	Just like the Hall of Blood is used to build infantry units, the Dark Foundry is used to build vehicles.
5400180	Most vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. Some Dark Eldar vehicles, however, are light skimmers that are fragile even when facing standard ground troops. They compensate for this weakness with exceptional mobility and firepower.
5400181	Excellent! You now have a Dark Foundry. All Dark Eldar vehicles come from this building.
5400182	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap.
5400183	Once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can increase your Vehicle Cap by building Slave Chambers, just like Squad Cap.
5400186	Select your Dark Foundry and build a Raider.
5400187	Raiders are fast, open-topped battle platforms.  Although equipped with a Dark Lance, a powerful anti-vehicle weapon, they are most effective when garrisoned with an infantry squad to provide additional firepower.
5400190	To see this garrisoning in action, select a Warrior Squad, then right click on the Raider.  
5400191	Excellent! Your Raider is now manned and ready for battle.
5400192	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points and Tortured Slaves to build Towers of Loathing on them.
5400193	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure to build Slave Chambers when necessary to increase both your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
5400194	While in Cover, most units will slow down to navigate the difficult terrain. Due to their incredible agility, however, the Dark Eldar can move through Cover at full speed.
5400195	Welcome to the single-player campaign of Dawn of War: Soulstorm. These tutorial windows will guide you through the first two turns of play and introduce key features of the Dawn of War campaign mode.
5400196	Your goal is to conquer all four planets of the Kaurava system. Each planet is made up of multiple territories, which you will conquer one at a time.
5400197	The campaign map is your primary interface for directing your troops’ strategic moves. Individual battles are fought on the smaller-scaled battle map.
5400198	This province is your stronghold, or home territory. It is from here that you are launching your conquest of the Kaurava System. If your stronghold is ever conquered, you will be pushed out of the planetary system and lose the campaign.
5400199	Since this is the first turn, this is the only territory you currently control.
5400200	The enemy factions each have their own strongholds, identified by banners on the campaign map. To win the campaign and make the entire Kaurava system yours, you must conquer all eight enemy strongholds.
5400201	The icon of your commander indicates the current position of your main army. You can only attack a destination that can be reached from the province where your army is, so its position on the map defines your options.
5400202	The enemy factions each have armies of their own and also can only attack adjacent territories. Some of your enemies may have powers that allow them to move in different ways, so be wary.
5400203	These arrows show you where your army can move or attack this turn. Red arrows indicate attacks into enemy provinces. Green arrows indicate moves into friendly provinces.
5400204	Since this is your first turn, and you only control your stronghold, you must attack an enemy territory.
5400205	To move to or attack, left-click to select that province and then click on the Attack or Move button in the right panel. Begin by attacking one of the territories adjacent to your army. After moving or attacking, you will have to end your turn in order to move or attack again.
5400206	This screen shows you the forces you are leading into an attack and allows you to return to the campaign map if you decide you don’t want to attack yet.
5400207	Since this is your first attack, most options aren't yet available.
5400208	When you're ready to attack, just click on the Attack button. This will load the actual battle, where you will face enemies in a game of Dawn of War.
5400209	As you conquer more and more provinces, you'll be awarded pieces of special equipment for your commander. This equipment is called wargear.
5400210	You will never be awarded a specific piece of wargear. Instead, for each award, you get to choose one piece from the list on this screen. (Note that you may have to get some pieces of wargear to unlock other, more powerful versions.)
5400211	Congratulations! You have conquered your first province. This victory has given you several rewards, including a piece of wargear.
5400212	Every territory yields a certain amount of Planetary Requisition per turn. Additionally, many territories provide special bonuses, such as honor guard units. Look for bonuses in the right-hand panel when you select a province.
5400213	The honor guard are special units that can be trained to accompany your commander in battle. Purchase honor guard units from the Commander or the Attack Screen. Take note that if you lose the territory that provided you with an honor guard unit, you will lose the ability to purchase that unit.
5400214	Other provinces will grant small resource bonuses for battles, or contain Ancient Gates that allow travel between the planets.
5400215	This is the territory you've just conquered. Notice that it has changed to your color and that your army is on it. Whenever you conquer a province, your army moves there.
5400216	You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn, new provinces will be open to attack.
5400217	When you are ready to let the enemy factions act, click on the End Turn button.
5400218	The enemy repelled your attack on the province.
5400219	Each of the enemy factions will now act in turn. Like you, they each have their own strongholds and armies. They will each move their armies or attack and reinforce their territories in turn.
5400220	Pay attention to where your enemies' armies are. Armies will reinforce nearby friendly provinces under attack, bolstering the defense with additional troops.
5400221	One of your territories is under attack.
5400222	You can choose to fight on the battle map or to auto-resolve this battle. Auto-resolving can be dangerous, however, since it depends on the relative strength of your province and the attacker's forces. You always stand a better chance of triumphing against great odds if you fight the battle yourself. There are also pieces of wargear that can only be earned by fighting defensive battles on the battle map: another advantage to fighting without auto-resolve.
5400223	If you choose to fight and your army is on the province, your commander and his honor guard will join the defense. If not, you'll have to make do with whatever forces are garrisoned there.
5400224	You'll notice that you have gained Planetary Requisition from the provinces you control. Each province produces Planetary Requisition every turn. To garner your full allotment of Requisition, you must maintain supply lines. This means that all territories must be part of a chain of territories that you possess, tracing back to your stronghold.
5400225	Use Planetary Requisition to reinforce your provinces by stationing troops and buildings there and to train honor guard units.
5400226	To reinforce a province, simply left-click on a province you own and then click on the Reinforce button in the right-hand panel.
5400227	This screen allows you to garrison troops and buildings in a territory. These purchases will be ready when you fight to defend this province from enemy attacks.
5400228	Stationing troops and building buildings in a province costs you Planetary Requisition. The available units are on the panel. Use the arrows at the top to move between different options.
5400229	Later, you can recall these troops (if the province is no longer at risk). Recalling a unit will give you back half the Planetary Requisition you spent to station it in the first place. Be careful. All your purchases will be final once you accept the changes on this screen.
5400230	This screen provides you with a snapshot of your progress in the Kaurava Conflict. It includes a running tally of your conquests, your commander's statistics, your honor guard and more.
5400231	If you haven't yet trained an honor guard unit (or you've lost one in battle), you can train it on this screen by simply clicking on its icon.
5400232	You can also access the Wargear Screen from here.
5400233	Congratulations. You have just conquered an enemy race's stronghold. This victory ends that race's attempt to take the planetary system for themselves. If you can conquer the seven remaining enemy strongholds, you will win the game.
5400234	There may still be some provinces held by the defeated race, but without a stronghold they no longer have an army or the ability to attack. You can mop up their remaining provinces to gain the associated bonuses, or you can move on to other targets.
5400235	You have received a new bonus power.
5400236	Every race you conquer will grant you the power that race possessed. 
5400237	To learn about the special ability you earned, select the conquered stronghold and mouse over the bonus icon on the right panel. You can also see all the powers you have earned on the Commander Screen.
5400238	You have just conquered a territory containing an Ancient Gate. These ancient artifacts allow you to travel to certain other Ancient Gates on other planets. 
5400239	The arrows leading off of the planet indicate where you can travel. Holding provinces with these gates can be of great strategic importance.
5400240	Traveling between Ancient Gates is no different than moving between territories. Note that if you use it, you will have to conquer whoever owns the province at the destination.
5400241	One or more of your provinces has become disconnected from your primary area of control. This area is defined as all the provinces that can be reached from your stronghold, without having to pass through enemy territory.
5400242	While these provinces are disconnected, you cannot collect your full Planetary Requisition. Restore the supply lines to collect your full due.
5400243	By playing as the Sisters of Battle, you possess the power to build forward bases. Before any attack, you may purchase buildings, in addition to honor guard units. 
5400244	Purchased buildings will be present at the outset of the battle. However, unlike honor guard units, they will not travel with your commander into other fights.
5400245	By playing as the Imperial Guard, all your honor guard and garrison purchases automatically come at a reduced price.
5400246	Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400247	By playing as the Space Marines, you possess the power to build special garrison troops called Deep Strike Squads. You can only purchase these troops from your stronghold.
5400248	While Deep Strike Squads reside in your stronghold, they can be deployed anywhere in the Kaurava System, at a moment’s notice. This means that before any battle, you can choose to use Deep Strike Squads that you had previously purchased.
5400249	To add Deep Strike Squads, select the Reinforce button on your stronghold. Then use the arrow buttons on the left panel to select Deep Strike Squads, and purchase as many as you see fit.
5400250	By playing the Orks, your garrison reserves will automatically increase, very slowly. After several turns of play, you will notice that some provinces have increased size on their own.
5400251	By playing the Tau, you possess the power of the Ar’Ka Cannon. This powerful cannon, is fired right before your commander makes an attack, and will usually destroy some of the garrison forces in that enemy province.
5400252	The cannon fires automatically, and does not require your direction.
5400253	By playing the Eldar, you posses the Fleet of Foot power. Your commander can move up to three entire provinces when moving through friendly territory. 
5400254	You may attack on the first, second, or third move, but attacking will always end your movement for the turn.
5400255	By playing the Necron, you possess the ability to recover some of your troops after a battle. This power works both when you are attacking or defending, as long as you do not lose when defending against an enemy.
5400256	Any troops recovered will automatically be returned to your honor guard or garrison list, after the battle.
5400257	By playing as the Chaos Space Marines, you are not limited to supply lines. Your enemies must maintain a direct connection between all of their territories and their stronghold, in order to collect full Planetary Requisition.
5400258	You can use this fact to your advantage by severing their supply lines without having to worry about your own.
5400259	Excellent, you now have 100 Soul Essence! 
5400260	Excellent, you have completed the Ecclesiarchal Cathedral!
5400261	By playing the Dark Eldar, you possess the ability to travel freely between Ancient Gates. In fact, you are the only faction that has an Ancient Gate in your base.
5400262	These ancient artifacts allow travel between the planets of the Kaurava System. While other races can only travel certain paths using the Ancient Gates, you can travel from any Ancient Gate province to any other Ancient Gate province. 
5400263	Traveling between these gates is not different than traveling between territories normally. However, take note that you will have to fight whoever owns the gate province you are traveling to!

5400271	This is the territory you've just conquered. Notice that it has changed to your color and that your army is on it. Whenever you conquer a province, your army moves there. \ You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn, new provinces will be open to attack. \ When you are ready to let the enemy factions act, click on the End Turn button.
5400272	The enemy repelled your attack on the province. \ You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn you will be able to attack again and avenge yourself. \ When you are ready to let the enemy factions act, click on the End Turn button.
5400273	Each of the enemy factions will now act in turn. Like you, they each have their own strongholds and armies. They will each move their armies or attack and reinforce their territories in turn. \ Pay attention to where your enemies' armies are. Armies will reinforce nearby friendly provinces under attack, bolstering the defense with additional troops.
5400274	One of your territories is under attack. \ You can choose to fight on the battle map or to auto-resolve this battle. Auto-resolving can be dangerous, however, since it depends on the relative strength of your province and the attacker's forces. You always stand a better chance of triumphing against great odds if you fight the battle yourself. There are also pieces of wargear that can only be earned by fighting defensive battles on a battle map: another advantage to fighting without auto-resolve. \ If you choose to fight and your army is on the province, your commander and his honor guard will join the defense. If not, you'll have to make do with whatever forces are garrisoned there.
5400275	It is now your turn to act again. \ You'll notice that you have gained Planetary Requisition from the provinces you control. Each province produces Planetary Requisition every turn. To garner your full allotment of Requisition, you must maintain supply lines. This means that all territories must be part of a chain of territories that you possess, tracing back to your stronghold. \ Use Planetary Requisition to reinforce your provinces by stationing troops and buildings there and to train honor guard units. \ To reinforce a province, simply left-click on a province you own and then click on the Reinforce button in the right-hand panel.
5400276	This screen allows you to garrison troops and buildings in a territory. These purchases will be ready when you fight to defend this province from enemy attacks. \ Stationing troops and building buildings in a province costs you Planetary Requisition. The available units are on the panel. Use the arrows at the top to move between different options. \ Later, you can recall these troops if the province is no longer at risk. Recalling a unit will give you back half the Planetary Requisition you spent to station it in the first place. Be careful. All your purchases will be final once you accept the changes on this screen.
5400277	This screen provides you with a snapshot of your progress in the Kaurava Conflict. It includes a running tally of your conquests, your commander's statistics, your honor guard, and more. \ If you haven't yet trained an honor guard unit (or you've lost one in battle), you can train it on this screen by simply clicking on its icon. \ You can also access the Wargear Screen from here.
5400278	Congratulations. You have just conquered an enemy race's stronghold. This victory ends that race's attempt to take the planetary system for themselves. If you can conquer the seven remaining enemy strongholds, you will win the game. \ There may still be some provinces held by the defeated race, but without a stronghold they no longer have an army or the ability to attack. You can mop up their remaining provinces to gain the associated bonuses, or you can move on to other targets.
5400279	You have received a new bonus power. \ Every race you conquer will grant you the power that race possessed. \ To learn about the special ability you earned, select the conquered stronghold and mouse over the bonus icon on the right panel. You can also see all the powers you have earned on the Commander Screen.
5400280	You have just conquered a territory containing an Ancient Gate. These ancient artifacts allow you to travel to certain other Ancient Gates on other planets. \ The arrows leading off of the planet indicate where you can travel. Holding provinces with these gates can be of great strategic importance. \ Traveling between Ancient Gates is no different than moving between territories. Note that if you use it, you will have to conquer whoever owns the province at the destination.
5400281	One or more of your provinces has become disconnected from your primary area of control. This area is defined as all the provinces that can be reached from your stronghold, without having to pass through enemy territory. \ While these provinces are disconnected, you cannot collect your full Planetary Requisition. Restore the supply lines to collect your full due.
5400282	By playing as the Sisters of Battle, you possess the power to build forward bases. Before any attack, you may purchase buildings, in addition to honor guard units. \ Purchased buildings will be present at the outset of the battle. However, unlike honor guard units, they will not travel with your commander into other fights. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400283	By playing as the Imperial Guard, all your honor guard and garrison purchases automatically come at a reduced price. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400284	By playing as the Space Marines, you possess the power to build special garrison troops called Deep Strike Squads. You can only purchase these troops from your stronghold. \ While Deep Strike Squads reside in your stronghold, they can be deployed anywhere in the Kaurava System, at a moment's notice. This means that before any battle, you can choose to use Deep Strike Squads that you had previously purchased. \ To add Deep Strike Squads, select the Reinforce button on your stronghold. Then use the arrow buttons on the left panel to select Deep Strike Squads, and purchase as many as you see fit. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400285	By playing the Orks, your garrison reserves will automatically increase, very slowly. After several turns of play, you will notice that some provinces have increased size on their own. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400286	By playing the Tau, you possess the power of the Ar’Ka Cannon. This powerful cannon, is fired right before your commander makes an attack, and will usually destroy some of the garrison forces in that enemy province. \ The cannon fires automatically, and does not require your direction. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400287	By playing the Eldar, you posses the Fleet of Foot power. Your commander can move up to three entire provinces when moving through friendly territory. \ You may attack on the first, second, or third move, but attacking will always end your movement for the turn. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400288	By playing the Necron, you possess the ability to recover some of your troops after a battle. This power works both when you are attacking or defending, as long as you do not lose when defending against an enemy. \ Any troops recovered will automatically be returned to your honor guard or garrison list, after the battle. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400289	By playing as the Chaos Space Marines, you are not limited to supply lines. Your enemies must maintain a direct connection between all of their territories and their stronghold, in order to collect full Planetary Requisition. \ You can use this fact to your advantage by severing their supply lines without having to worry about your own. \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400290	By playing the Dark Eldar, you possess the ability to travel freely between Ancient Gates. In fact, you are the only faction that has an Ancient Gate in your base. \ These ancient artifacts allow travel between the planets of the Kaurava System. While other races can only travel certain paths using the Ancient Gates, you can travel from any Ancient Gate province to any other Ancient Gate province. \ Traveling between these gates is not different than traveling between territories normally. However, take note that you will have to fight whoever owns the gate province you are traveling to! \ Conquer enemy strongholds to obtain their racial powers, added to your own.
5400291	Welcome to the Dawn of War tutorial. By listening to me and reading the text that appears in this message box, you will learn how to play a Skirmish game.
5400292	Congratulations! You have just learned how to select units and structures in the game.
5400293	Take note of the small bar that is gradually filling up. This Progress Bar gives you an indication of how close something is to being ready.
5400294	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
5400295	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
5400296	Capturing a Strategic Point takes time. Do not move the capturing squad away from the Strategic Point until the progress bar is full. Otherwise, you will not take control of the Strategic Point.
5400297	Excellent! The point is ours! You must continue to capture Strategic Points to get more Requisition Resource, which allows you to build more units and structures.
5400298	The Listening Post fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
5400299	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Listening Posts on all your captured Strategic Points.
5400300	Some structures, vehicles, and research require Power to function. Building a Plasma Generator will supply you with the Power you need to keep your force going.
5400301	The more Plasma Generators you have, the faster you will build up the Power Resource.
5400302	Now we should focus on bringing our squads to full strength by reinforcing them.
5400303	You can click the Reinforce Squad button multiple times to bring the squad to full strength.
5400304	Your field base has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
5400305	You can see your current Squad Cap in the Resource Area at the top of your screen.
5400306	Once you have reached your maximum Squad Cap, you will not be able to call in any additional troops, so it's very important to keep an eye on this as you're building up your forces.
5400307	The best way to make sure you have enough Requisition Resource is to capture and secure Strategic Points.
5400308	Explore the map around your base with your squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must capture 3 Strategic Points.
5400309	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Listening Posts on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
5400310	You can capture Critical Locations just like Strategic Points. In some multiplayer games, capturing and holding one or more of these Critical Locations can win you the game! You also get Requisition from any Critical Locations you control.
5400311	Use a squad to capture a Critical Location. Critical Locations are points on the map that represent locations of critical strategic importance.
5400312	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Listening Posts built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
5400313	Holding Relics gives you access to your army's best units and vehicles. Hold on to them to ensure you have access to your best technology!
5400314	Use a squad to capture a Relic. Relics are sacred points of great value.
5400315	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Listening Posts to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
5400316	Vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. They are a fundamental part of your army, and can carry powerful support weapons.
5400317	Congratulations! You've completed the learning session of the tutorial.
5400318	It is time to put what you have learned to work. Take control of the force and build up your strength so you can crush your enemy!
5400319	Continue to build structures, and carry out research that will increase your effectiveness in battle.
5400320	Take this battlefield, and the next, and the next after that. The fight will never end until your enemies are crushed.
5400321	Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requisition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
5400322	Slag Deposits are concentrated points of energy hidden just under the planet's surface.
5400323	Take a quick look at your Mini-Map. There are dots on the map that represent Slag Deposits.
5400324	Build a Thermo-Plasma Generator on a Slag Deposit to access large amounts of the Power Resource.
5400325	Now select a squad and take note of the small blue bar just over the squad's Health bar. This blue bar represents the Morale of your squad.
5400326	Morale represents the effectiveness of your units in battle. Think of it as a combination of mental focus, courage, and the willingness to fight.
5400327	Various weapons in the game inflict Morale damage as well as Health damage. When your squad takes Morale damage, the small blue bar will decrease, just like the Health bar does.
5400328	When a squad's Morale becomes too low, the squad will break. A broken squad has lost the will to fight, and its combat effectiveness is drastically reduced.
5400329	You do not lose control of broken squads. It is your choice whether to leave them in battle, or retreat to gather strength.
5400330	Morale can be an effective tool against your enemies. Also remember that certain units have abilities that can increase the Morale of a squad.
5400331	By destroying your enemy's Morale, you cause them to lose combat effectiveness, making them much easier to kill. In this way, a small but properly armed squad can destroy an enemy force of superior numbers.
5400332	Remember, tactics and strategy can turn the tide of almost any battle. Make sure you use this knowledge to achieve victory on the battlefield!
5400333	Some types of terrain can provide your squads with protection from enemy fire. This is called Cover.
5400334	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
5400335	Cover is useful in that it can provide your squads with additional defensive bonuses, which make them harder to kill.
5400336	It's easy to see Cover in the terrain -- just look for your mouse cursor to change as you pass over large bombed-out craters in cities, or patches of thick foliage in jungles.
5400337	You'll notice that when you move your squads into an area of Cover, a small Cover icon will appear above them. This indicates they are receiving a defensive bonus.
5400338	Excellent! Your squad is in Cover. Units in Cover are harder targets to shoot and take less damage from Ranged attacks because of this. Use Cover well to gain tactical advantages over your enemies.
5400339	In order to further establish your base you need an Ecclesiarchal Servitor.
5400340	Select your Ecclesiarchal Chapel and build an Ecclesiarchal Servitor.
5400341	In order to further establish your base you need a Tortured Slave.
5400342	Select your Kabal Fortress and build a Tortured Slave.
5400343	To increase the number of squads you can field as the Sisters of Battle, you need to add the Holy Icon upgrade to more Listening Posts. If all of your Listening Posts are upgraded, you must capture and upgrade more.
5400344	To increase the number of squads you can field as the Dark Eldar, you need to build additional Slave Chambers.
5400345	You've reached the maximum number of squads you're allowed to field. Be sure to Reinforce your squads to full strength to get the most out of them.
5400346	All units and vehicles have a Health rating. Health is represented by the small green bar underneath each squad or vehicle.
5400347	If you lose any units during a fight, you can Reinforce to bring your squad back to full strength.
5400348	Make sure you watch the strength of your squad in battle. Reinforce often, to make sure your squads are as effective as possible.
5400349	Remember that when a unit with a heavy weapon dies, you lose that weapon from the squad. You will need to upgrade the squad to get the heavy weapon back.
5400350	Notice the white ring that appears around some of your structures when you are deciding where to build. This is the Control Zone.
5400351	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Listening Posts, can be built at other locations.
5400352	When you are trying to place a new structure, its color changes from Red to Green as you move it around.
5400353	A Green color indicates that the structure can be placed at that location so that building will begin.
5400354	
5400355	
5400356	
5400357	
5400358	Researches are available at the Ecclesiarchal Chapel to increase your Squad Cap, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
5400359	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure to upgrade your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap when necessary.
5400360	To increase the number of squads you can field as the Sisters of Battle, you need to research squad cap upgrades from your Ecclesiarchal Chapel.
5400361	
5400362	
5400363	
5400364	
5400365	Soul Essence is represented by a swirling ethereal mist that surrounds recently killed corpses. Be sure to harvest quickly, as souls only stay on this plane for a short time.
5400366	
5400367	Holy Icons, built on top of Listening Posts, increase your maximum Faith.
5400368	Select a Listening Post now and upgrade it by clicking the Holy Icon button.
5400369	Excellent! Your Listening Post is now adorned with a Holy Icon, a blessed symbol of the Emperor's favor.
5400370	Holy Icons are vital to the Sisters' war effort. Guard them with your life - both the size and power of your army depend on keeping them from falling to the enemy.
5400371	Now that you have a Holy Icon, you have unlocked the first tier of your Faith meter. Located in the upper-left corner of the screen, the Faith Meter shows your current stores of this important resource. 
5400372	Note that most of the meter is still blocked off - by building more Holy Icons, you will unlock more potential Faith, which will in turn allow you to call upon ever more powerful Acts of Faith.
5400373	So far, however, you have only unlocked the potential of Faith. To generate Faith, you must make Faithful units.
5400374	Once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can increase your Vehicle Cap by researching the appropriate upgrade at your Manufactorum, much like the Squad Cap.
5400375	To increase the number of squads you can field as the Sisters of Battle, you need to research the appropriate upgrade at the Adepta Sororitas Convent.
5400376	Researches are available at the Adepta Sororitas Convent to increase your Squad Cap, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
5400377	To increase the number of squads you can field as the Sisters of Battle, you need to build research squad cap upgrades from your Adepta Sororitas Convent.
5400378	Holy Icons are vital to the Sisters' war effort. Guard them with your life - the power of your army depends on keeping them from falling to the enemy.
5400379

5400381	
5400382	The mouse is your primary method of surveying the battle, selecting units and structures, and issuing orders.
5400383	The mouse controls the camera. The camera represents your current view of the battlefield.
5400384	To pan the camera, simply move the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen. Do this now.
5400385	To rotate the camera to gain a different view of the battle, press the 'ALT' key, and move your mouse. Do this now.
5400386	You can zoom in on something to see it up close by spinning the mouse-wheel forward. Do this now.
5400387	To return the camera to the game's default view, press the 'Backspace' key on your keyboard. Do this now.
5400388	Excellent, you've returned the camera to its default playing view.
5400389	By panning, rotating, and zooming the camera in and out, you can gain whatever view of the battlefield you wish.
5400390	To quickly return the camera to your base from anywhere on the battlefield, press the 'Home' key on your keyboard. Do this now.
5400391	Excellent, you've returned the camera to your base. 
5400392	The diamond-shaped display in the lower left-hand corner of your screen is your Mini-map.
5400393	You can use the Mini-map to see where your units and structures are located, to quickly scan the battlefield, to issue quick orders, and so forth.
5400394	The Mini-map displays the locations of all Strategic Points on the battlefield, as well as other items of strategic importance.
5400395	Fog of War prevents you from seeing things where you do not have a presence. As you move units into an area, the Fog of War will be lifted.
5400396	Hide the taskbar by clicking the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar.
5400397	When the taskbar is hidden, you will notice the Mini-Map stays revealed.
5400398	To issue commands and upgrade your squads you can either unhide the taskbar or use the 'hotkeys'.
5400399	To return to the full taskbar, simply click the Skull icon again.
5400400	Now we will bring up the Objective Menu.
5400401	The Objective Menu provides you a list of all the Primary and Secondary Objectives assigned to you by the game. Mouse over the Objectives to get the description of each.
5400402	Excellent! Anytime you want to refer to the Objectives Menu, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
5400403	Remember, if you aren't sure what you need to do next you should always check your current Objectives.
5400404	To check your Objectives, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
5400405	Congratulations! You've completed the learning session of the tutorial.
5400406	It is time to put what you have learned to work. Take control of the force and build up your strength so you can crush your enemy!
5400407	You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn you will be able to attack again and avenge yourself.
5500000
