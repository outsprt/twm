100000	Fallen City (2)
100001	The battle for the city of Magna Bonum has left little that is recognizable. This sacred city must not fall into the hands of the enemy!
100002	Valley of Khorne (2)
100003	Once home to a lively and welcoming peasant village, this valley was tainted by the horrors of Chaos.  Khorne took note of the daily, bloody rituals its people were performing, supposedly in the name of their living god the Emperor.
100004	Outer Reaches (2)
100005	On the very outskirts of the known galaxy lie mysteries to enthrall and inspire fear in the hearts of even the most faithful man.  What was once discovered here, only the dead now know.

100018	Hellfire Canyon (2)
100019	The rich ore deposits in this canyon have made the jungle world of Uldan a hotly disputed planet. Every known power in the galaxy has made an attempt to wrest this world from the grip of the Imperium, with the exception of the Tyranids, but time will soon remedy this exception.
100020	Edemus Gamble (2)
100021	The term Edemus Gamble was first coined after Inquisitor Edemus risked life, limb and retinue to retrieve the relic lost at the Battle of Garn 7.  Typically, such a term is used to predict failure, as the Inquisitor lost life, limb, and retinue in the process.
100022	Faceoff (2)

100107	Colonel Ryn “Biffy” Drecker was summarily executed after his actions at the Cathedral of the Drowning Saint.

100109	The mainstay of Tartarus was its once mighty industrial core, now a heap of rubble and ruin wrought by the hands of Chaos.

100113	The questionable actions of Colonel Ryn "Biffy" Drecker can be traced back to this mountain pass where he first encountered Chaos forces in an attempt to secure passage through the tainted mountains.
100114	Tainted Place (4)
100115	As the battle continued they forgot why they were fighting. Only that they must hold the center at all costs, and they would travel to the hills to beg favour from their Gods.
100116	Doom Spiral (4)
100117	This winding mountain was nicknamed the Spiral of Doom by the unfortunate Guardsmen who had to wrest it from the forces of the Eldar Farseer Envyan. The casualties, as the name would suggest, were enormous, but The Hammer of the Emperor eventually prevailed.
100118	Torrents (4)

100155	"You will fight in the streets, the alleys, and in the habs! You will fight for the enemy’s death, not your own lives!

100158	Mortalis (6)
100159	The Mortalis is a historical site of great significance. It is here, in the center of the jungle, that the first attack upon the Calthronian people occurred at the turn of the 39th millennium. Many died then, and more will die now.
100160	Crossroads (6)
100161	Once a major driver of the Imperium's commercial engine, all was changed when Warboss Orkamungus and his warband ravaged the area. These days, the Crossroads are hotly contested as a supply route, with all takers hoping control will give them an edge in their greater conflicts on this planet.
100162	Dread Alley (6)
100163	Even when the city was inhabited, the citizens prefered to avoid Dread Alley.  Rife with gangers and muties, every twist and turn in this hovel has the potential to hide death in waiting.

100165	"But sir, this jungle, it feels like it's closing in on us... I can't take it any longer... it's like walls are closing in on us!" - such is noted by Commissar Caern as the traitorous actions of Guardsman 11689 prior to summary execution.

100205	Located on a Death World harboring the most voracious of carnivorous animals the rich mineral deposits are constantly contested.

400363	Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!
400400	The Craftworld sings to me, and I respond in kind.
400410	Command me to build.
400411	My music is a pillar upon which whole worlds have been built.
400412	We are shaped by Fate, just as we shape it.
400420	Shall I play the music, here then?
400421	Take me to where I may call forth the wraithbone.
400422	Show me a place that is ready to receive the gift of the Eldar.
400430	My music will shape the Wraithbone.
400431	I will call it forth from the Warp.
400432	You will have what you require.
400433	Nothing remains unchanged by the music of creation.
400434	Look, it changes as I play.
400500	Forces of Chaos, bow to me!
400501	Do not trifle with me, worm
400502	Cross me…and die,
400503	Show me the enemy.
400504	I seethe with purpose.
400505	I am here to lead you
400506	What do you want?
400507	Back off!
400510	They hear their doom approaching.
400511	I go.
400512	Take me to them, that I may render judgment.
400513	The ground trembles with every step.
400514	Don't think you can order me around.
400515	We play it your way, for now.
400520	Slaughter them all!
400521	Feast on their flesh!
400522	I will shatter their souls.
400530	Get me to battle!
400531	Do not make me wait.
400540	Find me more souls to corrupt.
400550	Their skulls will make good trophies
400551	I will show them a new kind of suffering.
400552	Their death pleases the Chaos gods.
400553	BALE (defensive stance)
400554	The best defense is a good slaughter.
400560	Let them come.
400561	Bring them to me.
400570	I'd rather kill with my hands.
400580	I will feast on their flesh!
400581	They will not escape the grip of Chaos
400590	Come, my minions. Let us steal their souls.
400591	You rabble are undeserving of my presense.
400600	Go now, and spread the taint as I have shown you!
400601	Weaklings, I will fight alongside you no longer!
400610	Ahhh… fresh sacrifices.
400611	Run weaklings… it pleases me!
400612	Your kind will be destroyed
400620	Imperial maggots approach.  We will savor their destruction.
400621	Run, cowards, run!
400630	Followers of Chaos approach, they are too weak to oppose us.
400640	Tame the green ones…rend the flesh from their bones!
400650	Vile Eldar approach.  Destroy them.
400651	Crush the ancient ones!
400660	Artillery….Like the buzzing of flies.
400670	Ha! Keep trying little one…
400671	These little ones are dangerous
400680	Snipers!
400681	Snipers!  Fight me in the open!
400690	Ahhh…a fellow brother from the twisted pits of the Warp!
400700	It is a thing of monstrous beauty.
400710	Back into the shadows, to fight another day…
400711	We are defeated, accept your weakness and fall back.
400712	Fall back and regroup!
400713	We will be back.
400720	You didn't truly expect to stop the forces of Chaos!
400721	We have returned.
400722	Our vengeance shall be swift and brutal.
400730	Your soul is mine!
400731	Can you weaklings not fight any better?
400732	You weaklings!
400733	Destroy them all!
400734	KILL! KILL!
400735	Pathetic creatures!
400736	Can no one offer me a challenge?!?
400737	Meet your death!
400738	Maggots!
400740	The forces of Chaos call for your destruction!
400741	Fear the taint!
400742	For Chaos!
400750	Now I have the power to destroy…everything.
400751	Forces of Chaos, fill me with power!!!
400800	For the Dark Gods.
400801	Chaos Raptors, ready to kill.
400804	We are filled with the power of Chaos!!!
400805	Must…Obliterate!!!
400806	Rhino Transport reporting.
400807	Predator here, the armoured fist of Chaos!
400810	At your command
400811	Yesss masster
400812	My Lord
400813	Your will?
400814	Yes?
400815	What would you have us do?
400816	Point us at our prey.
400817	We soar on wings of fire.
400818	We live for the hunt.
400819	We...must...kill!
400820	Enemies…we need enemies.
400821	Do you hear the voices too?
400822	Ahhh…the Chaos gods speak clearly now.
400823	It is as though a thousand mouths cry out in pain.
400824	Sanity is for the weak.
400825	I feel the Warp overtaking me…it is a good pain.
400826	Transport, ready.
400827	Where can we take the armies of Chaos?
400828	We will deliver pure evil into the heart of the battle.
400829	After a thousand battles, one sees only death.
400830	All weapons primed and ready for battle.
400831	Just take us into the thick of it.
400832	Prepared for battle.
400840	On our way
400841	The path to ruin
400842	As you command
400843	Bah!  When do we attack!
400844	We are Legion!
400845	Death to the false emperor
400846	Fly, against the enemy!!
400847	None can travel faster.
400848	We shall strike them from the skies!
400849	Take us to battle.
400850	That is the way to Hell.
400851	Chaos consume us!
400852	Of course, we do your bidding.
400853	Chaos is our master.
400854	We are the destroyer!
400855	As quickly as we can.
400856	With great haste, to spread the taint more quickly.
400857	The best way to travel.
400858	We will crush their skulls under our iron treads.
400859	Nothing can stop us now.
400860	Their weapons are ineffective against Chaos armour.
400861	Moving out.
400862	Agreed.
400870	Engaging the enemy
400871	Die scum
400872	Feel our wrath
400873	As you wish
400874	Skulls for the Skull Throne!
400875	Feel the wrath of Chaos
400876	They will know pain
400877	We can taste their blood already!
400878	They will not escape us.
400879	We will tear the flesh from their bones!
400880	DESTROY!  DESTROY!
400881	We will strip the flesh from their bones.
400882	Kill…crush…rend them limb from limb.
400883	Crush, kill, and destroy.
400884	We see the target.
400885	We will strike them down.
400886	Let fly, all guns!
400887	Hammer them 'til they fall!
400888	There will be nothing left to bury.
400900	We are embarking
400901	We ride to battle
400902	Oh, are we leaving so soon?
400910	Exit quickly
400911	To battle
400912	Deploying now
400913	Good…back into the thick of it!
400920	Nothing will survive
400921	The only command worth following is the command to attack.
400922	We will hunt them down
400923	We will chase them down, like the dogs they are.
400924	The hunt begins!
400925	Their screams will echo for eternity.
400926	Ah..freedom to destroy.
400927	Yes, that's best…let's go after them!
400928	We will crush them without mercy.
400929	There will be nothing left of them.
400930	On high alert, covering all firing arcs.
400931	The march of Chaos is unrelenting.
400932	They will beg for mercy as we run them down.
400940	Be vigilant in defense
400941	They are not worthy
400942	They cannot get past us.
400943	We will repel the enemy as we go.
400944	We will surprise the enemy with our resilience!
400945	The world will be drenched in their blood.
400946	They couldn't be crazy enough to cross us.
400947	Switching to defensive positioning.
400948	Moving with a purpose.
400949	Their weapons will not harm us.
400950	This area will be held
400951	We will hold the point against all aggressors.
400952	You mean we must stay in one place?
400953	Circling the objective.
400954	We will stand fast against them.
400955	Alright…we'll stay here and wait for them to come to us.
400956	We will hold this position against all who advance.
400957	We'll dig in and wait.
400960	Rip them to shreds!
400961	They will not get close
400962	They will die before they reach us!
400963	Ready your weapons
400964	We will fell the enemy before they can get closer.
400965	Easily done.
400966	Yessss…shoot, kill, destroy!
400970	We shall taste their blood
400971	We will cleave their skulls
400972	Better to see the terror in their eyes.
400973	They fight helplessly against our onslaught.
400974	We will bathe in their blood.
400975	We will crush them!  Crush them!
400980	For the dark gods
400981	For the glory of Chaos
400982	To glory!
400983	This Honour will be ours
400984	It is easily done.
400985	Raptors, take the point!
400986	Yessss.
400987	The location will be ours.
400988	The objective is not lost on us.
401000	It is done
401001	We will rejoice later… to Battle!
401002	The point is ours.
401003	We have it, as ordered.
401004	We have captured a location.
401005	We hold it now.
401006	We have it now.
401007	Now what?
401010	Fresh victims
401011	Enemy Spotted
401012	Our prey is near
401020	Die loyalist scum
401021	Lapdogs of the false emperor
401022	Defile the fools
401030	Crush the weak
401031	Hostile Chaos are in the area
401032	A Chaos Foe is near
401040	Orks are in the area
401041	We see the Orks
401042	The green horde approaches
401050	The Eldar are near
401051	Ah…our old foe.
401060	Their Artillery weakens us!
401061	Meeting resistance
401062	The Weak fight back!
401063	We are taking fire.
401064	We are under attack!
401070	The cowards have snipers!
401071	They dare not show themselves
401080	They dare bring daemons against us?!
401100	That would make a great sacrifice!
401101	We must slaughter the monster
401110	Raptors, to the hunt!
401111	Take to the skies!
401112	They will never see us coming.
401113	Deploying Smoke
401120	Squad Destroyed
401121	Chaos Lord destroyed.
401122	Chaos Sorcerer destroyed
401123	Vehicle Destroyed
401124	Heretic Destroyed.
401130	Squad Broken
401131	They are too strong!
401132	Support us!
401133	Damnation! Where is our support
401134	The battle is lost!
401135	Flee, the enemy has us in their grasp!
401136	We must retreat!
401137	Take to the skies!!!
401138	Even a warped mind can see the odds stacked against it.
401139	Flee now, fools!
401140	They will overcome us!
401141	I see the maw of despair swallowing me…
401150	The gods favour us!
401151	The power of Chaos gives us strength
401152	We will have our revenge
401153	Revenge
401154	We return to battle, and this time we will not fail!
401155	We are back for more blood.
401156	It was a momentary madness…
401157	We're back and better than ever.
401158	Once more into the fray.
401160	Chaos consume you!
401161	You are marked for death.
401162	Despair, for your end is near!
401163	MAIM!  KILL!  BURN!  MAIM! KILL! BURN!
401164	KILL! KILL!
401165	Crush them!
401166	You are already dead!
401167	You cannot overcome us.
401168	You cannot even die right!
401169	None can stand against me.
401170	I am unstoppable.
401171	Your death brings me closer to Chaos.
401172	Now you will die!
401173	Chaos is your doom!
401180	Death to the enemy!
401181	Rejoice in the coming oblivion!
401182	You will be killed by traitor's hands.
401183	Destroy the weak!!!
401184	Annihilate them!
401185	ATTACK!  ATTACK!
401186	MAIM!  KILL!  BURN!  MAIM! KILL! BURN!
401187	KILL! KILL!
401188	Tear their eyes out!
401189	Death, from above!
401190	We are upon the enemy!
401191	We'll send the enemy to hell and worse!
401192	To the battle!
401193	Chaos has come to judge you!
401194	For the glory of Chaos!
401195	The Dark Powers triumph!
401196	Their souls will be utterly destroyed.
401200	The true power is here!
401210	Guide me wisely…
401211	I am power.
401212	I command the darker powers.
401213	Chaos is the only true answer.
401214	My abilities are at your disposal.
401215	I understand more than you could possibly know.
401216	Yes?
401220	Yes.
401221	If that is your wish
401222	The ancient powers of Chaos go where they please.
401223	It will be done.
401224	Are you sure?
401230	I will tear them limb from limb.
401231	None can stand against the coming darkness.
401232	The lust for blood is never satiated.
401233	The Chaos gods demand their souls.
401234	Chaos rewards those who kill in its name.
401235	Take me to the next battle.
401236	There are souls to crush elsewhere.
401237	Ahhh…a fresh crop of victims.
401240	They do not know the true power of Chaos.
401241	Let me chase them down.
401242	It is futile to delay your inevitable end.
401245	Let them rage against us, to no avail.
401246	They approach our line, full of fear and loathing.
401247	Stand, and be accounted for.
401248	They rush towards their doom.
401249	I will take them down.
401250	Watch the cowards fall into despair.
401251	I will crush them underfoot.
401252	They fight so feebly.
401255	My wicked intellect will lead us to victory.
401256	You will have need of me.
401257	I have done all I can to show you the ways of Chaos.
401260	It cannot be!!!
401261	I…will…return.
401265	The enemy got lucky…it won't happen again!
401266	I will burn them!
401270	Your soul is mine!
401271	Can you weaklings not fight any better?
401272	Your attempts at combat are feeble.
401275	Chaos comes for you!
401276	Your death will mirror your pathetic life!
401277	Fall now, for your end is at hand!
401280	Your only lot in life is to die quickly and with great pain.
401281	Your cries for pity will not move me.
401282	Do not die too easily. I want you to suffer.
401290	Pathetic creatures!
401291	I am a god!
401292	The forces of Chaos are mine to command!
401293	That's right, come to me, come to me and die!!!
401294	Your souls will be mine!
401300	Colonel Brom here.
401310	Yes.
401311	How can I serve?
401312	What is it you desire?
401313	Hm?
401320	The Emperor Protects.
401321	It will be done.
401322	I will see that it happens.
401323	On my way.
401330	Attack, men!  Attack!
401331	Hold formation and attack!
401332	Imperial Guard, Charge!
401340	I will engage targets freely as you have directed.
401350	Holding this area.
401360	Stand down, men, stand down.
401370	Engaging at range.
401380	Engaging in close combat.
401390	Colonel Brom taking command.
401391	Men, you will follow my directives from here on out.
401400	I'm leaving you in command.  Do not give me reason to return.
401410	We must withdraw!
401411	Fall back!
401420	Returning to duty.
401430	Stand and fight!
401431	In the name of the Emperor you will hold!
401432	Form up, men!
401440	For the Emperor!
401441	Charge!
401500	We are Chaos!  Chaos is strong!
401510	Yes, Lord?
401511	What is your wish, great one?
401512	We will serve you, and in return grant us the power of the Dark Gods.
401513	How can I serve?
401514	We can serve you.  We are eager to please!
401515	Enemies of the dark gods, beware
401516	Grant us gifts of the Chaos Gods, great one!
401517	You favor us with your attentions!
401520	As you command
401521	Wherever you wish
401522	We are eager to prove ourselves.
401523	Crush! Kill! Destroy!
401524	Yes, master!  Right away, master!
401525	We are your favorites, are we not?
401526	You are the master.
401530	For the great gods!
401531	Kill them all!
401532	Attack!  Attack!  Attack!!!
401533	Destroy them!
401540	Quickly!  Go!  GO!
401541	This mechanized beast will carry us to battle!
401550	Where is the enemy!
401551	That was unpleasant.
401560	None shall stand against us!
401561	Attack?  Yes, yes, yes!!!
401570	With our lives!
401571	As you wish, we will not leave this area.
401580	We should just…stand here?
401581	What if the enemy approaches?
401590	If we're to fight the enemy at range could we get better weapons?
401591	We would rather spill the blood of the enemy up close.
401600	We will make the enemy bleed!
401601	Charge the enemy on sight!
401610	It is ours for the taking.
401611	We will control this entire world a point at a time.
401612	We shall capture it.
401620	Our victory is assured!
401621	We captured it for Chaos!
401630	Lord?  We need help!
401631	The Gods have forsaken us!
401632	Master, we must flee!
401633	The enemy are too strong!
401640	Do not punish us! We will not run from the enemy again!
401641	We have returned to the battle, surely we deserve the gifts of Chaos.
401642	We are ready to fight!
401650	Charge!
401651	For the Dark Gods!
401660	How have we failed?
401661	Please send us support!
401662	Kill! Maim! Destroy!
401663	All shall fall to Chaos!
401664	Die!  Die!
401665	Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
401666	Kill them all!
401670	We return from exile.
401680	You have need?
401681	The wanderers have returned.
401682	We walk the path less travelled.
401683	You cannot imagine what we have seen with our eyes.
401684	You called us back?
401685	We return to defend the Craftworld.
401686	We seek the adventure that only war can bring.
401690	Silent, and swift!
401691	We move effortlessly.
401692	We yearn to wander
401693	We move unseen.
401694	Just name your target.
401695	We have traveled much darker paths.
401700	Their blood will be spilled
401701	Let us hunt.
401702	We strike without fear or hesitation.
401703	The enemy is within range.
401710	Do not keep us from the land for too long.
401711	Take us to where we can best serve the cause.
401720	At last, the open sky!
401721	All good things must come to an end.
401730	We will prepare an ambush
401731	No enemy shall remain standing.
401732	We deal out death from the shadows.
401740	Assuming defensive posture
401741	We'll keep the enemy pinned down.
401742	Crossing firing arcs for maximum defense.
401750	We shall remain here, unseen
401751	We will hold this position.
401752	Nothing shall get past our invisible wall.
401760	Rangers do not miss
401761	We shall break their spirit
401762	It suits the far reach of the long rifle.
401770	We will despatch them
401771	Their last thought will be to wonder how we got so close.
401772	We will approach them, unseen.
401780	Objective sighted
401781	We approach the designated target.
401782	Ahh yes…the stationary target.
401790	It is now in our hands.
401791	We hold the objective.
401800	We are one with the shadows
401801	Cameleoline activated.
401802	The enemy will never spot us
401803	With haste.
401804	With speed.
401805	With caution.
401806	Slowly, and with care.
401810	We must retreat to the webway!
401811	Fallback and Reload…reload!! The enemy is upon us!
401820	Ahhh…the darkness has passed.
401821	Back into the fray!
401830	To the death!
401831	Engage the enemy!

401882	Concentrating all energy on the enemy
401890	We are needed elsewhere, to direct the course of this battle
401891	Transport us, so we may rest our minds
401900	Great thanks
401901	We will go our separate ways here…
401902	Our paths must separate here
401910	We shall focus our efforts on the pursuit of the enemy
401920	It is our fate to defend this area
401921	We will defend for as long as it takes
401922	We shall remain defensive until the time is right for change.
401930	Stand fast!
401931	Do not let the enemy through
401932	We will protect this vital area, for it affects the future of this battle
401933	The future of this battle requires this area to be defended at all cost
401940	We will harness our minds should the enemy approach within range
401950	If needs be, we will fight them in hand to hand combat
401951	Even in close quarters they will fear us
401960	We will make it ours
401961	It will be done
401970	We have secured the area
401971	Mission successful
401980	<Subverbal chanting.>
401990	Gah! Our concentration is impaired! Retreat!
401991	Our focus is undone, we must retreat
401992	Must…. Clear…. Mind…. Fall back!

402235	In the name of the destroyer! Attack!
402236	We are one with our weaponry.
402237	Time to destroy.
402240	They will be reduced to cinders.
402241	I shall sacrifice their souls to Khaine.
402242	Ah! More enemies to fight!
402243	Good…more walking sacrifices to Khaine.
402244	They burn well.
402245	Kill!  Kill! Kill!
402246	Burn them!  Must burn them!!!

402252	Give the enemy no quarter!
402253	Bringing weapons to bear on the enemy.
402254	Our weapons cut through them like a blade through air.
402255	Bringing full weaponry to bear.
402256	They will be utterly destroyed.
402257	Their existence is a momentary distraction.
402260	Embarking.
402261	Agreed.
402270	Take us to a better firing position
402271	Somewhere, there are more enemies to fight.
402280	Disembarking
402281	We are here.
402290	We are ready to redeploy.
402300	We will hunt the enemy
402301	The hunt begins
402310	They shall feel our wrath.
402311	Our attack on the enemy will be unrelenting.
402320	We will fire at will
402321	We shall eradicate them.
402322	With extreme prejudice.
402330	They will die in their baptism of fire.
402331	Khaine's anger seethes through me. To battle!
402332	Their lives are but a fleeting moment.
402340	We will hunt down the enemy wherever he stands.
402341	We bring all our firepower to bear on the target.
402350	This location shall remain secure
402351	Adopting defensive stance
402360	Let them come!
402361	This location shall remain secure
402370	We shall stand guard
402371	We'll lay down covering fire.
402380	They come in hordes, to meet their doom.
402381	Let them come then, to die by my sword.
402390	We will strike them down as they advance.
402391	Our crossfire is deadly.
402400	We shall protect this area
402401	You wish us to stand ground
402410	They will not get past us.
402411	We shall hold the line.
402420	None shall move us
402430	Do not make me stand here, idle.
402431	None who approach me shall live to tell of it.
402440	We'll do what we can to hold this position.
402441	The enemy will not push us back.
402450	Keep the enemy distant
402451	Engage from afar
402452	Firing at will
402460	Death spinners ready
402461	Weapons at the ready.
402470	Their will to fight will be broken

402480	They will die before they can fight back
402481	Combat knives at the ready.
402490	In close for the kill!
402491	We can close insantly with the enemy.
402500	Howling Banshees would serve you better!
402501	Hand to hand it is.
402510	We can not fail.
402511	Closing in on the objective.
402520	We focus on the temporal objective.
402530	It is as good as done.
402531	Consider the territory in our hands.
402532	Give it not a moment's thought.
402540	Success!
402541	Our mission is successful
402550	The Eldar control this place.
402551	Would that the universe could be held so easily.
402560	Let them try to move us.
402561	The enemy will not come near this place.
402570	With haste.
402571	With speed.
402572	With caution.
402573	Slowly, and with care.

402586	The upstart humans!
402587	The humans have ignored our warnings, and for that they must be exterminated.
402588	Mon-Keigh!
402590	Vile servants of Chaos approach!
402591	The great enemy!
402592	Our eternal battle against Chaos continues.
402593	Chaos Sighted
402600	The horde has arrived.
402601	The Orks are on the move.
402602	Orks approach.
402603	Orks! - their stench fills the air!
402605	Artillery!  Spread out and keep your eyes to the sky.
402606	We are under artillery barrage!
402607	Incoming Artillery, avoid the blast!
402610	We are taking damage…
402611	Danger has found us.
402612	Incoming enemy fire
402613	We are under enemy fire
402615	Snipers! We must take cover!
402616	Snipers!
402617	A sniper has targeted us
402620	Enemy Heavy Support in the area
402621	Enemy vehicles, honing in on their position.
402622	We have enemy vehicles in our sights.
402623	Heavy Support sighted
402625	Creatures of the Warp!
402626	A daemon has escaped to this realm.
402627	Aieeee! Daemons!
402630	By our ancestors, look at the size of it!
402631	A beast of legend!
402632	Save us from this monstrousity!!!
402633	You have but to ask.
402635	Do not keep us waiting.
402637	Swiftly, sisters!
402640	Our numbers are too few
402641	We must retreat!
402642	We must not waste our lives!
402643	We cannot win!
402644	It cannot end this way!
402645	NO!
402646	We will not survive this! Flee!
402647	Their attacks are too powerful
402650	Retreat to the Warp!
402651	We must fade away!
402652	It is over!
402655	The destroyer has turned on us!
402656	Flee, the enemy is upon us!
402660	We shall not abandon our duty.
402661	By the stars, we have survived.
402662	Our warrior heart shines once more.
402663	Regroup
402664	Assuming combat formation again
402665	Fate has decided this is not our time, yet…
402666	We are ready to fight again.

402685	None shall escape my wrath!!
402686	Into battle, with blazing fury!
402687	So we meet upon the field of battle!
402688	I shall celebrate your destruction.
402689	KHAINE!!!
402690	You will die by Eldar hands!
402691	Prepare to meet your end!
402692	Attack!
402693	Why don't you die!
402694	Exterminate them!
402695	Die!
402696	We must prevail!
402700	Embrace your destruction, fools!
402701	Crush the enemy!
402702	Taste the bitter cup of defeat!

402721	Is that all the strength you can muster?
402722	DESTROY!!!
402723	BURN!!!
402724	ALL SHALL DIE!!!
402730	We're going down!
402731	Can't maintain-
402732	NO!
402740	All those that oppose the Eldar shall fear my wrath!
402741	I have arrived.
402750	My powers are yours now.
402751	The future seems so…clear.
402752	The future is clouded and uncertain.
402753	The random hand of fate delivers me to you.
402754	Nothing is hidden from my sight.
402755	I knew you would have need of me.
402756	Naturally.
402757	Shall I divine your next move?
402758	The mists of space and time retreat from my mind.
402759	I sense the enemy.  They are closing in.
402760	The enemy cannot hide from my sight.
402761	How can I help?
402762	What needs to be done?
402770	Follow, my kin!
402771	I go to war.
402772	As you wish.
402773	The path is clear to me.
402774	Yes, that is the way.
402775	The runes have been cast.
402776	The pieces are in place, it is time for us to make our move.
402777	You give wise counsel.
402778	The logic is clear.
402779	It is the best course of action.
402780	All is clear to me, now.
402781	For our ancestors.
402782	It will be done.
402790	We fight because we must.
402791	I am sure of the outcome.
402792	I will enjoy delivering their destruction.
402793	Victory is our fate.
402794	Their defeat is not a matter of when, but how.
402795	Their death is assured.
402796	They cannot escape their fate.
402797	Their death comes as prophesied.
402798	I foresee their destruction.
402799	I will join the dance of death.
402800	Show them the face of their destroyer.
402801	You cannot ask for that which I give freely.
402810	Charge the enemy!
402811	We must hold the enemy back!
402812	Strike quickly!  Strike now!
402820	I am needed elsewhere.  Take me.
402821	Go swiftly, pilot.
402822	Fate calls me to my next victory.
402830	Here, at last.
402831	We arrive, as predicted.
402832	The runes foretold of this place.
402840	My mind stands ready.
402841	My will is a keen edge, poised to strike.
402850	No alien shall sat foot on this ground.
402851	I will hold this area with my life if I must.
402860	They will come to us.
402861	Let them come.  It matters not.
402870	The enemy will find that the Eldar's reach is long.
402871	I will engage the enemy at range.
402880	The enemy shall face me on open ground, and not find me wanting.
402881	I will engage the enemy in close combat battle.
402890	My vision will guide them.
402891	Follow my lead.
402892	The twisted skein of fate smiles on us.
402893	The runes say our paths must cross.
402900	I have shown them the way.
402901	Now we must travel alone.
402902	I can show them the path, but they must walk it.
402903	Our time together has reached its end.
402910	The enemy is upon us!
402911	Our enemies are here!
402920	The children of Terra approach!
402921	The ignorant humans are here.
402922	The humans come to hasten their destruction.
402923	Space Marines are attacking!
402924	We shall lead them down a twisted path of death!
402925	They are no concern to us.
402930	The great enemy!
402931	It is the worst of all evils!
402932	The forces of Chaos are here!
402933	Destroy the forces of Chaos or we may yet know a fate worse than death.
402934	We cannot allow Chaos to triumph.
402935	We may not survive this battle.
402940	Orks approach.  They are a cancer, we are the cure.
402941	Orks!  It is time we rid the world of their kind.
402942	The Green Ones ceaseless rampage continues.
402950	Rogue Eldar, we must destroy them!
402951	It is a sad day when Eldar meet Eldar in battle.
402952	Enemies!  They are our own kin!
402953	Their extermination shall be for their own good.
402960	Artillery!  Move nimbly, and with caution!
402961	An artillery barrage is hitting close to our position.
402970	I am in peril!
402971	The end for me draws near.
402972	I need help, or I will soon join our ancestors in the infinity circuit!
402973	Let us not waste our lives in this way!
402974	We will not last long under this onslaught!
403000	We are taking fire, I should have foreseen this.
403001	We are under attack!
403002	We face an inferior foe.
403003	I am under attack!
403010	Snipers!  Our enemies are truly devious.
403011	We are taking sniper fire.  I shall divine the enemy's location.
403012	We are taking sniper fire.
403020	The enemy believes their tanks are a match for the Eldar.
403021	The enemy's crude vehicles approach.
403022	An enemy tank!  No match for our bright lances.
403030	A Daemon!  A monstrosity!  It cannot be allowed to walk in this realm.
403031	Daemons, our ancient foe.  To war, my kin!
403032	The Children of Chaos cannot be allowed to stand.
403033	The Great Destroyer is here!
403040	A monstrosity too horrible to behold!
403041	It cannot be…do my eyes deceive me!?!
403042	My eyes burn from the horror of witnessing such a beast.
403043	My nightmares whispered that such an abomination could exist.
403050	The enemy has prepared for our arrival.
403051	Stationary weapons.  How quaint.
403052	It appears the enemy is attempting to resist.
403053	Take out those guns!
403060	I need protection!
403061	Could defeat be imminent?
403062	The battle is not going in our favor.
403070	I have lost my vision!  I need assistance!
403071	My direction is no longer clear!
403072	My mind is too weary to fight on.
403080	I can see clearly once more.
403081	I knew the fates did not foretell of my end.
403082	It was but a momentary weakness.
403090	Stand fast, my kin!
403091	We shall be victorious!
403092	My mind shall bring you focus!
403093	Focus your minds with me!
403094	Hold your position!
403095	To me, my kin!
403100	I command in the name of the Emperor!
403110	On alert, Brothers.  The enemy must be nearby.
403111	Beware the alien, the mutant, the heretic.
403112	While the enemies of the Emperor still draw breath their can be no peace.
403113	He who stands with me shall be my brother.
403114	Praise the Emperor.
403115	The Emperor Protects.
403116	My faith is my shield.
403117	What would you have me do?
403118	Today the enemy shall know fear.
403120	This day shall be a glorious one for the Imperium.
403130	For the Emperor!
403131	We are united in His service.
403132	Follow my lead.
403133	For Terra!
403134	We shall know no fear.
403135	Faith and Duty!
403136	For the honour of the Chapter.
403137	Agreed.
403138	I serve mankind.
403139	I shall not fail.
403140	For the glory of the Emperor!
403141	Confirmed.
403150	My aim shall not falter!
403151	By my command, attack!
403152	Follow me into battle!
403153	Space Marines advance!
403160	Be swift driver.
403161	Take me to the front.
403170	This is where I leave you.
403171	Drop me here and await further orders.
403180	I will crush all in my path.
403181	I will show no mercy.
403182	Pity those who stand in my way.
403190	This situation calls for a defensive posture.
403191	I shall protect this area in the name of the Emperor.
403192	If they come, they die.
403200	To the last man, and the last round.
403201	I shall stand resolute.
403202	I am the Imperium's shield.
403210	Every shot shall kill.
403211	Boltgun protect.
403220	They will die by my hand.
403221	My fists will smite them.
403230	Taking Command.
403231	Together to victory.
403232	To me brothers.
403240	My duty calls.
403241	Duty calls me elsewhere.
403242	I am needed elsewhere.
403250	Our foe approaches.
403251	The enemy are here.
403260	Brothers! The great enemy approaches!
403261	The forces of Chaos are here.
403262	Chaos approaches.
403270	Foul Greenskins approach.
403271	Orks! Do not underestimate their strength.
403280	Eldar! Beware their trickery.
403281	The alien Eldar are upon us!
403290	Artillery, take cover men.
403291	It is merely artillery, stand your ground.
403300	We are taking damage.
403301	They dare fire upon Space Marines?
403302	My power armour will protect.
403303	Emperor protect us!
403304	I shall not die on this day!
403310	Snipers!
403311	Neutralise those snipers!
403312	Take out their snipers!
403320	I will not stop until that daemon is cast back into the warp!
403321	Fear me, warp spawn!
403322	Daemon!  Fear my wrath!
403330	It's power does not match it's size.
403331	Do not be daunted by it's size.
403332	Fear not the size of the enemy.
403340	My will is undone!
403341	Men!  We must withdraw!!
403342	Withdraw and regroup!
403343	Initiate a tactical withdrawal!
403350	Regroup!
403351	Back into the Fray!
403352	Brothers! Regroup!

403580	Whatever you desire.
403581	Anything for the Great Powers.
403582	My life is forfeit.
403583	Bless us, great one.
403584	We're here for the Dark Gods.
403590	As you wish
403591	Yes, yes, of course.
403592	Anywhere you like, Lord
403593	I try to do your will!
403594	(urgent) Yes!  Yes!  Right away!
403595	(pleading) I swear to you it will happen!
403600	We serve!
403601	We will build it for you.
403602	But of course, master.
403603	Yes, yes, we will work faster!
403604	Thank, you.  Thank you Master.
403610	We are the Harbingers of death.
403620	We exist to avenge our sisters.
403621	Our cries herald the coming of great pain for our enemies.
403622	All fear the voice of death, calling to them.
403623	We are the messengers of doom.
403624	We are here to exact harsh vengeance.
403625	Many are called.  Few survive.
403630	We go to war, my sisters.
403631	Show us the way, we will not fail you.
403632	No enemy can stand before our blades.
403634	We will follow your commands.
403636	Combat is our path, you must lead us to it.
403638	We shall pass our sorrows to the enemy on this day.
403640	We go…to die.
403641	To battle!
403642	Khaine guide our blades!
403643	None shall survive.
403644	Our swords shall taste blood.
403645	Our song is the vehicle of their destruction.
403646	We exist for this purpose alone.
403647	We shall cleanse the universe of their pathetic existence.
403648	They will pay dearly for their trespasses.
403649	We shall be their death.
403650	To the battlefront, pilot!
403651	Deliver us to battle!
403652	The battle calls, and we shall answer.
403653	Do not delay.
403654	Take us from here.
403660	We have been too long from battle.
403661	We leave you now.
403662	You have served your purpose.
403663	You have walked your path, now we must walk ours.
403670	We will take the battle to the enemy.
403671	Only fools dare stand against us.
403672	They will be dead before they see us coming.
403680	None shall pass.
403681	We will protect this area with our lives.
403690	Our blades shall form an impassible wall.
403691	A shield of death awaits them.
403692	Let them come.
403693	If you insist.
403700	Ranged combat is not the path we walk.
403701	We should engage the enemy in close combat.
403710	This is our path.
403711	We will stand face-to-face with the enemy and see them vanquished.
403720	The enemy is too strong!
403721	Khaine, give us strength!
403722	Our skills are not enough against this foe!
403730	It cannot be done.  We must retreat.
403731	Our strength fails us…
403732	Is this our end?
403733	We have failed, death comes for us.
403740	We are ready to return to the fray.
403741	It was but a moment's weakness.
403742	Weakness will plague us no more, my sisters.
403750	You are inferior!
403751	Taste our blades!
403752	Exterminate them!
403760	Guardsmen reporting!
403761	Ready to serve

403831	Fire at will.
403840	Attach bayonets!
403841	Prepare for the assault!
403850	Starting bombardment.
403860	The Emperor has abandoned us!
403861	Retreat!
403862	Run for your lives!
403863	We can't hold!
403870	Form up, men, there's work to be done!
403871	We are the Imperial Guard, it is time we started acting like it!
403872	Regroup!
403880	Hold the line!
403881	Check your ammo!
403882	Fight in His name!
403883	I don't wanna die!
403890	Charge!
403891	Attack!
403900	The Inquisition has arrived.
403910	I am prepared.
403911	None can stand before the Inquisition.
403912	Yes?
403913	I am ready to pass judgement..
403920	Agreed.
403921	We think alike.
403922	I will crush the enemy beneath my boot.
403923	No one will stop us.
403930	I shall crush you beneath my Inquisitorial boot.
403931	They will burn.
403932	Death to the heretics.
403933	Their judgement is at hand.
403940	I will hunt them to the ends of the universe.
403941	None shall escape my wrath.
403950	I claim this area in the name of the inquisition.
403951	I will hold this area or die trying.
403960	I will not budge from this spot.
403961	I cannot be moved.
403970	I will engage the enemy from afar.
403971	I shall burn them where they stand.
403980	I shall smite them.
403981	I will take the fight to the enemy.
403990	By order of the Inquisition I am taking command here.
404000	You must stand on your own.
404010	In His name!
404011	For the Emperor!
404012	For the Inquisition!
404013	Burn, foul creature!

404173	I stand ready.
404174	Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.
404175	Knowledge is power.  Hide it well.
404176	An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded.
404177	There is no such thing as innocence, only degrees of guilt.
404180	Through the destruction of our enemies do we earn our salvation.
404181	I can sense the enemy.  They are close.
404182	At your command.
404183	I serve.
404184	I shall never tire.
404185	Do I detect uncertainty in your purpose?

404290	I speak His word!
404300	We must fall back!
404301	I cannot prevail!
404302	This course of action is un-wise.
404310	I know no fear.
404311	My mind is focused and ready for action.
404312	I am ready.
404320	You will fall, heathen!

404352	Even in death I still serve.
404353	I am the instrument of His will.
404354	It is better to die for the Emperor than to live for your self.
404355	At last, back to war!
404356	I am ready to serve, again.
404360	To me, my Brothers!
404361	I will crush those who stand before me!
404362	Moving out.
404363	I will be there soon.
404364	By His word.

404366	I will purge the unclean.
404370	I shall end you!
404371	Burn, heretic!
404372	Identifying Targets
404373	Die!  Die!  Die!
404374	I have waited long for this day.

404400	None shall pass.
404410	Long Range Weapons online.

500064	Excellent, you've returned the camera to its default playing view.

500066	Center the camera on your base
500067	Press the 'Home' key on your keyboard to center the camera on your base.
500068	To quickly return the camera to your base from anywhere on the battlefield, press the 'Home' key on your keyboard. Do this now.
500069	Excellent, you've returned the camera to your base.
500070	Select the Stronghold

500072	hint text
500073	To select a unit or structure, simply click on it with the left mouse button. Go to your base and select the Stronghold.
500074	Congratulations! You have just learned how to select units and structures in the game.
500100	Build a Scout Marine Squad

500102	Scout Marine Squad hint text
500103	Select your Stronghold and look for the Scout Marine Squad icon located in the lower-right corner of the screen. Click this button now.
500104	Take note of the small bar that is gradually filling up. This Progress Bar gives you an indication of how close something is to being ready.
500105	Excellent! You now have a Scout Marine Squad.
500110	Capture a Strategic Point
500111	Use a Scout Marine Squad to capture a Strategic Point. Capturing and securing Strategic Points earns more Requisition.
500112	Capture hint text
500113	Order the Scout Marine Squad to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
500114	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
500115	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
500116	Capturing a Strategic Point takes time. Do not move the capturing squad away from the Strategic Point until the progress bar is full. Otherwise, you will not take control of the Strategic Point.
500117	Excellent! The point is ours! You must continue to capture Strategic Points to get more Requisition Resource, which allows you to build more units and structures.
500120	Build a Servitor
500121	Use your Stronghold to build a Servitor. Servitors are required to build additional structures. Servitors are always available from the Stronghold.

500126	In order to further establish your base you need a Servitor.
500130	Build a Listening Post
500131	You must use your Servitor to build a Listening Post. Listening Posts are a way of securing Strategic Points so they can not be taken, and increasing the amount of Requisition generated by the Strategic Point they are on.
500132	hint text
500133	Select the Servitor and build a Listening Post on the captured Strategic Point.
500134	The Listening Post fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
500135	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Listening Posts on all your captured Strategic Points.
500140	Build a Chapel-Barracks
500141	Use your Servitor to build a Chapel-Barracks. The Chapel-Barracks is used to build Space Marine squads, who will form the backbone of your army. Creating a Chapel-Barracks will also unlock new kinds of squads and buildings.
500142	Chapel-Barracks hint text
500143	Select your Servitor and build a Chapel-Barracks structure.

500160	Build a Force Commander
500161	Select the Chapel-Barracks and build a Force Commander. The Force Commander is much more powerful than your average warrior and acts as a hero for your army. You can upgrade him with powerful abilities through research available later in the tech tree.
500162	hint text
500163	Select the Chapel-Barracks and build a Force Commander. The Force Commander acts as a hero for your army.
500164	The Force Commander is a veteran of thousands of battles, and his combat prowess is unrivalled. He will lead your force to victory.
500165	Excellent! The Force Commander has arrived. The Force Commander cannot capture points but is a skilled warrior who can be upgraded with powerful abilities.
500167	The Space Marines' other commander unit will become available as you build more facilities and unlock more research.
500170	Attach your Force Commander to a squad
500171	Select your Force Commander, click the Attach button, and select the squad you want to attach him to.
500172	hint text
500173	Select your Force Commander and click the Attach button. Now, select a Space Marine Squad.
500174	Notice how when the Force Commander joins the squad, they rearrange themselves to make room for their esteemed leader.
500175	This Space Marine Squad is greatly enhanced by the addition of the Force Commander, but he can also fight effectively on his own.
500176	To detach the leader from this squad, simply select the squad, then click the Detach icon. It is located in the same place as the Attach icon.
500180	Upgrade the Stronghold
500181	It is time to upgrade the Stronghold, your headquarters. By researching the Monastery upgrade, you will gain access to Squad Leaders for your Space Marine Squads and better weapons from the Armory.
500182	
500183	Select the Stronghold and click the Monastery Upgrade icon.
500184	We must upgrade the Stronghold to a Monastery to gain access to Squad Leaders and other powerful research options and structures.
500185	Leaders are highly skilled warriors that can be added to some Space Marine squads. You will need strong leaders if you are to defeat your enemies.
500186	The Monastery is complete! You can now add Sergeants to some of your Space Marine squads.
500190	Add a Sergeant to your Space Marine Squad
500191	Some squads, like Space Marine Squads, can add a Leader. Sergeants provide an excellent boost to the squad's morale. Select a squad, then click the Add Leader: Sergeant icon to build a Sergeant.
500192	
500193	Select a Space Marine Squad and click the Add Leader: Sergeant icon.
500194	Sergeants are valiant leaders that improve the combat ability and morale of the squad they are part of.  They will inspire your Marines to greater feats of heroism.
500195	Excellent! Your Sergeant has arrived. Note that your Sergeants are part of the squad and cannot leave it.
500200	Build an Armory
500201	You must use your Servitor to build an Armory. Once complete, the Armory will grant you access to special weapons for your squads.
500202	
500203	Select your Servitor and build an Armory now.
500204	You must build an Armory in order to access weapon upgrades. Squads can be equipped with a variety of weaponry, allowing you to prepare them against different enemy types.
500205	
500206	Excellent, the Armory is operational.
500210	Upgrade your Space Marine Squad's weaponry
500211	The Armory unlocks access to heavy weaponry for your infantry squads. Upgrade a Space Marine Squad with Heavy Bolters.
500212	Upgrade Weaponry hint
500213	Select your Space Marine Squad and click the Upgrade: Heavy Bolter icon to upgrade a squad member.
500214	Notice a Heavy Bolter appears in one of your squad member's hands. This procedure can be performed with any of the available weapon upgrades.
500215	Initially you can only upgrade 2 units of your total squad with heavy weapons. By doing further research at the Armory you can unlock the capability to upgrade more.
500216	Excellent. You have upgraded your Space Marine Squad. You can upgrade your squads anywhere on the battlefield to weapons that are well suited to counter your enemy.
500220	Build a Plasma Generator
500221	Use your Servitor to build a Plasma Generator. Plasma Generators provide the Power you need for your special units, weaponry, vehicles, structures, and abilities. Power is the second resource you must manage in Dawn of War.
500222	hint text
500223	Select your Servitor and build a Plasma Generator.
500224	Some structures, vehicles, and research require Power to function. Building a Plasma Generator will supply you with the Power you need to keep your force going.
500225	The more Plasma Generators you have, the faster you will build up the Power Resource.
500226	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Stronghold.
500227	
500230	Reinforce your Space Marine Squad
500231	Use the Reinforce function to add units to your Space Marine Squad. You can Reinforce anywhere in the battlefield to replenish your squads if some of your units fall in battle.
500232	hint text
500233	Select a Space Marine Squad. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
500234	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.
500235	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a brother Space Marine falls to the enemy.
500236	You can click the Reinforce Squad button multiple times to bring the squad to full strength.
500237	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Space Marine Squad.
500240	Build and upgrade another Space Marine Squad
500241	Build another Space Marine Squad, Reinforce it to full strength, Upgrade it with 2 special weapons, and Add a Leader.
500242	hint text
500243	Select your Chapel-Barracks and build another Space Marine Squad.
500244	Your field base has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
500245	You can see your current Squad Cap in the Resource Area at the top of your screen.
500246	Once you have reached your maximum Squad Cap, you will not be able to call in any additional squads, so it's very important to keep an eye on this as you're building up your forces.
500247	You can increase your Squad Cap by building certain structures and researching upgrades, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
500248	Excellent! You have built a Space Marine Squad and brought it to full strength. To mount an effective attack, you should try to have several Space Marine Squads, fully Reinforced to maximum strength and Upgraded with special weapons and a Sergeant.
500250	Capture and Secure more Strategic Points
500251	To make sure you have enough of your main resource, Requisition, you need to capture and secure more Strategic Points. Capture 3 Strategic Points and build Listening Posts on them.
500252	hint text
500253	Explore the map around your base with your Space Marine Squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must Capture 3 Strategic Points.
500254	The best way to make sure you have enough Requisition Resource is to capture and secure Strategic Points.
500255	
500256	Make sure you use your Servitor to build Listening Posts on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
500257	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Listening Posts on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
500260	Capture a Critical Location
500261	Critical Locations are points on the map that represent areas of critical strategic importance. In some multiplayer games, capturing one or more of these points can win you the game. Capture one now.
500262	hint text
500263	Use a squad to capture a Critical Location. Critical Locations are points on the map that represent locations of critical strategic importance.
500264	You can capture Critical Locations just like Strategic Points. In some multiplayer games, capturing and holding one or more of these Critical Locations can win you the game! You also get Requisition from any Critical Locations you control.
500265	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Listening Posts built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
500270	Capture a Relic
500271	Relics are sacred points of great value. Holding Relics will allow you access to your army's best units and vehicles.

500273	Use a squad to capture a Relic. Relics are sacred points of great value.
500274	Holding Relics gives you access to your army's best units and vehicles. Hold on to them to ensure you have access to your best technology!
500275	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Listening Posts to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
500280	Build a Machine Cult
500281	Use your Servitor to build a Machine Cult. The Machine Cult is used to build vehicles. Vehicles are tough and much stronger than non-upgraded infantry.
500282	hint text
500283	Use your Servitor to build a Machine Cult.
500284	Just like the Chapel-Barracks is used to build infantry units, the Machine Cult is used to build vehicles.
500285	Vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. They are a fundamental part of your army, and can carry powerful support weapons.
500286	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap. Just like Squad Cap, once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can research technology at your Stronghold that will increase your Vehicle Cap.
500287	Excellent! You now have a Machine Cult. You can build powerful vehicles from this building.
500290	To increase the number of squads you can field in Dawn of War, you click on the research items located on your Stronghold.
500291	You've reached the maximum number of squads you're allowed to field. Be sure to Reinforce your squads to full strength to get the most out of them. If you have invested unwisely, you can press the 'Delete' button on your keyboard to terminate unwanted squads.
500300	Congratulations! You've completed the learning session of the tutorial.
500301	It is time to put what you have learned to work. Take control of the force and build up your strength so you can crush your enemy!
500302	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points and Servitors to build Listening Posts on them.
500303	Continue to build structures, and carry out research that will increase your effectiveness in battle.
500304	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure you research upgrades that will increase both your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
500305	Take this battlefield, and the next, and the next after that. The fight will never end until your enemies are crushed.
500310	Take Cover
500311	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
500312	Cover hint
500313	Some types of terrain can provide your squads with protection from enemy fire. This is called Cover.
500314	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
500315	Cover is useful in that it can provide your squads with additional defensive bonuses, which make them harder to kill.
500316	It's easy to see Cover in the terrain -- just look for your mouse cursor to change as you pass over large bombed-out craters in cities, or patches of thick foliage in jungles.
500317	You'll notice that when you move your squads into an area of Cover, a small Cover icon will appear above them. This indicates they are receiving a defensive bonus.
500318	Excellent! Your squad is in Cover. Units in Cover are harder targets to shoot and take less damage from Ranged attacks because of this. Use Cover well to gain tactical advantages over your enemies.
500320	Very good! You are mastering advanced concepts that will help you to annihilate your enemies!
500321	Select a squad and take note of the small blue bar just under the squad's Health bar. This blue bar represents the Morale of your squad.
500322	Morale represents the effectiveness of your units in battle. Think of it as a combination of mental focus, courage, and the willingness to fight.
500323	Various weapons in the game inflict Morale damage as well as Health damage. When your squad takes Morale damage, the small blue bar will decrease, just like the Health bar does.
500324	When a squad's Morale becomes too low, the squad will break. A broken squad has lost the will to fight, and its combat effectiveness is drastically reduced.
500325	You do not lose control of broken squads. It is your choice whether to leave them in battle, or retreat to gather strength. Also, certain units have abilities that can increase the Morale of a squad.
500326	Morale can be an effective tool against your enemies.
500327	By destroying your enemy's Morale, you cause them to lose combat effectiveness, making them much easier to kill. In this way, a small but properly armed squad can destroy an enemy force of superior numbers.
500328	Remember, tactics and strategy can turn the tide of almost any battle. Make sure you use this knowledge to achieve victory on the battlefield!
500330	All units and vehicles have a Health rating. Health is represented by the small green bar underneath each squad or vehicle.
500331	Remember, a squad takes damage as a whole. When enough damage has been inflicted on the squad, a unit will die.
500332	If you lose any units during a fight, you can Reinforce to bring your squad back to full strength.
500333	Make sure you watch the strength of your squad in battle. Reinforce often, to make sure your squads are as effective as possible.
500334	Remember that when a unit with a heavy weapon dies, you lose that weapon from the squad. You will need to upgrade the squad to get the heavy weapon back.
500340	The diamond-shaped display in the lower left-hand corner of your screen is your Mini-map.
500341	The Mini-map provides important information that will help you win battles.
500342	You can use the Mini-map to see where your units and structures are located, to quickly scan the battlefield, to issue quick orders, and so on.
500343	Clicking anywhere in the Mini-map will move your camera to that location. This is useful when you need to survey the battlefield quickly, to make tactical decisions.
500344	Keep an eye on your Mini-map. It will help you see what is happening to units that you cannot currently see in your view screen.
500345	The Mini-map displays the locations of all Strategic Points on the battlefield, as well as other items of strategic importance.
500346	Fog of War prevents you from seeing things where you do not have a presence. As you move units into an area, the Fog of War will be lifted.
500347	When you have structures built in an area, the Fog of War in that area will remain revealed.
500350	Slag Deposits are concentrated points of energy hidden just under the planet's surface.
500351	Build a Thermo-Plasma Generator on a Slag Deposit to access large amounts of the Power Resource.
500352	Take a quick look at your Mini-Map. There are dots on the map that represent Slag Deposits.
500353	Servitors can build Thermo-Plasma Generators on Slag Deposits.
500360	Notice how each time a squad is Reinforced and a unit arrives, the squad rearranges itself to accomodate the new arrival. This is because squads work together as a unit.
500361	A squad responds to commands, such as move and attack, in harmony. This is the strength of the squad, and it allows you to control a large number of units on the battlefield more easily.
500370	Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requsition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
500380	Notice the white ring that appears around some of your structures when you are deciding where to build. This is the Control Zone.
500381	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Listening Posts, can be built at other locations.
500382	When you are trying to place a new structure, its colour changes from Red to Green as you move it around.
500383	A Green colour indicates that the structure can be placed at that location so that building will begin.
500390	Hide the Taskbar
500391	You can hide the taskbar by clicking on the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar. Try hiding the taskbar now.
500392	
500393	Hide the taskbar by clicking the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar.
500394	When the taskbar is hidden, you will notice the Mini-Map stays revealed.
500395	To issue commands and upgrade your squads you can either unhide the taskbar or use the 'hotkeys'.
500396	To return to the full taskbar, simply click the Skull icon again.
500400	Issue a Rally Point Command
500401	To issue a Rally Point command, select any building that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
500402	
500403	You've just issued a Rally Point command. You did this by selecting a structure capable of building squads or vehicles and right-clicking the ground nearby.
500404	Let's issue a Rally Point command.
500405	Select any structure that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
500406	When you issue a Rally Point command, you will notice a flag appears in the world. This flag will be visible whenever you have the structure selected.
500407	Any squads or vehicles that are built from that structure will automatically gather at the Rally Point when they are built.
500410	Now we will bring up the Objective Menu.
500411	The Objective Menu provides you a list of all the Primary and Secondary Objectives assigned to you by the game. Mouse over the Objectives to get the description of each.
500412	Excellent! Anytime you want to refer to the Objectives Menu, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
500413	Close the Objective Screen
500414	When you are familiar with the Objective Screen, click on the Close button to return to the Tutorial.
500415	Remember, if you aren't sure what you need to do next you should always check your current Objectives.
500416	To check your Objectives, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
500420	Build a Rhino Transport
500421	Select your Machine Cult and build a Rhino Transport.
500422	
500423	Select your Machine Cult and build a Rhino Transport.
500424	The Rhino Transport is the Space Marine's basic infantry transport. Exceptionally fast and well armoured, it is an excellent way to quickly move your infantry around the battlefield.
500425	Excellent! You now have a Rhino. You can try loading infantry into the Rhino Transport by selecting the squad and right-clicking on it.
500426	To unload the squad, click on the Unload icon on the Rhino Transport's taskbar.
500430	Build a Whirlwind
500431	Select your Machine Cult and build a Whirlwind.
500432	
500433	Select your Machine Cult and build a Whirlwind.
500444	Whirlwind artillery vehicles have a devestating but inaccurate area attack that can send infantry flying and pound buildings into dust.
500445	Excellent! Your Whirlwind can attack like a normal unit, or you can click the Ground Attack icon on the Whirlwind's taskbar and left-click the battlefield to fire the artillery at a specific location.
500446	
500450	Build a Dreadnought
500451	Select your Machine Cult and build a Dreadnought.
500452	
500453	Select your Machine Cult and build a Dreadnought.
500454	Dreadnoughts are dangerous mechanical walkers. They are feared in close combat and can be upgraded to have powerful ranged attacks.
500455	Excellent! Your Dreadnought is a lethal killing machine that can break infantry Morale, crush vehicles and help you defeat your enemy.
500456	
500460	The Space Marines have many vehicle options. Upgrade your Stronghold, capture Relics and stockpile Requisition and Power Resources to build them all.
500461	Don't forget to keep an eye on your Vehicle Cap. You cannot field more vehicles than you can support with your Vehicle Cap.
501010	Welcome to the Dawn of War tutorial. By listening to me and reading the text that appears in this message box, you will learn how to play a Skirmish game.
501020	
501021	The mouse is your primary method of surveying the battle, selecting units and structures, and issuing orders.

501113	Order the Slugga Boy Squad to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
501114	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
501115	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
501116	Capturing a Strategic Point takes time. Do not move the capturing squad away from the Strategic Point until the progress bar is full. Otherwise, you will not take control of the Strategic Point.
501117	Excellent! The point is ours! You must continue to capture Strategic Points to get more Requisition Resource, which allows you to build more units and structures.
501120	Build a Gretchin Squad
501121	Use your Settlement to build a Gretchin Squad. Gretchin Squads are required to build additional structures. Gretchin Squads are always available from the Settlement.

501126	In order to further establish your base you need a Gretchin Squad.
501130	Build Da Listening Post
501131	You must use your Gretchin Squad to build Da Listening Post. Da Listening Posts are a way of securing Strategic Points so they can not be taken, and increase the amount of Requisition generated by the Strategic Point they are on.
501132	hint text
501133	Select the Gretchin Squad and build Da Listening Post on the captured Strategic Point.
501134	Da Listening Post fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
501135	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Da Listening Posts on all your captured Strategic Points.
501140	Build Da Boyz Hut
501141	Use your Gretchin Squad to build Da Boyz Hut. Da Boyz Hut is used to build Shoota Boy Squads, who will form the backbone of your army. Creating Da Boyz Hut will also unlock new kinds of squads and buildings.

501216	Excellent. You have upgraded your Shoota Boy Squad. You can upgrade your squads anywhere on the battlefield to weapons that are well suited to counter your enemy.
501220	Build a Generator
501221	Use your Gretchin Squad to build a Generator. Generators provide the Power you need for your special units, weaponry, vehicles, structures, and abilities. Power is the second resource you must manage in Dawn of War.
501222	hint text
501223	Select your Gretchin Squad and build a Generator.
501224	Some structures, vehicles, and research require Power to function. Building a Generator will supply you with the Power you need to keep your force going.
501225	The more Generators you have, the faster you will build up the Power Resource.
501226	You now have Power! Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Generators can be built per Settlement.
501227	
501230	Reinforce your Shoota Boy Squad

501242	hint text
501243	Select Da Boyz Hut and build another Shoota Boy Squad.
501244	Your field base has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
501245	You can see your current Squad Cap in the Resource Area at the top of your screen.
501246	Once you have reached your maximum Squad Cap, you will not be able to call in any additional squads, so it's very important to keep an eye on this as you're building up your forces.
501247	You can increase your Squad Cap by building certain structures and researching upgrades, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
501248	Excellent! You have built a Shoota Boy Squad and brought it to full strength. To mount an effective attack, you should try to have several Shoota Boy Squads, fully Reinforced to maximum strength and Upgraded with special weapons and a Nob Leader.
501250	Capture and Secure more Strategic Points
501251	To make sure you have enough of your main resource, Requisition, you need to capture and secure more Strategic Points. Capture 3 Strategic Points and build Da Listening Posts on them.
501252	hint text
501253	Explore the map around your base with your Shoota Boy Squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must Capture 3 Strategic Points.
501254	The best way to make sure you have enough Requisition Resource is to capture and secure Strategic Points.
501255	
501256	Make sure you use your Gretchin Squad to build Da Listening Posts on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
501257	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Da Listening Posts on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
501260	Capture a Critical Location
501261	Critical Locations are points on the map that represent areas of critical strategic importance. In some multiplayer games, capturing one or more of these points can win you the game. Capture one now.
501262	hint text
501263	Use a squad to capture a Critical Location. Critical Locations are points on the map that represent locations of critical strategic importance.
501264	You can capture Critical Locations just like Strategic Points. In some multiplayer games, capturing and holding one or more of these Critical Locations can win you the game! You also get Requisition from any Critical Locations you control.
501265	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Da Listening Posts built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
501270	Capture a Relic
501271	Relics are sacred points of great value. Holding Relics will allow you access to your army's best units and vehicles.
501272	hint text
501273	Use a squad to capture a Relic. Relics are sacred points of great value.
501274	Holding Relics gives you access to your army's best units and vehicles. Hold on to them to ensure you have access to your best technology!
501275	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Da Listening Posts to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
501280	Build a Da Mek Shop
501281	Use your Gretchin Squad to build Da Mek Shop. The Da Mek Shop is used to build vehicles. Vehicles are tough and much stronger than non-upgraded infantry.
501282	hint text
501283	Use your Gretchin Squad to build a Da Mek Shop.
501284	Just like Da Boyz Hut is used to build infantry units, Da Mek Shop is used to build vehicles.
501285	Vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. They are a fundamental part of your army, and can carry powerful support weapons.
501286	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap. Just like Squad Cap, once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can research technology at your Settlement that will increase your Vehicle Cap.
501287	Excellent! You now have Da Mek Shop. You can build powerful vehicles from this building.
501290	To increase the number of squads you can field in Dawn of War, you click on the research items located on your Settlement.
501291	You've reached the maximum number of squads you're allowed to field. Be sure to Reinforce your squads to full strength to get the most out of them. If you have invested unwisely, you can press the 'Delete' button on your keyboard to terminate unwanted squads.
501300	Congratulations! You've completed the learning session of the tutorial.
501301	It is time to put what you have learned to work. Take control of the force and build up your strength so you can crush your enemy!
501302	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points, and Gretchin Squads to build Da Listening Posts on them.
501303	Continue to build structures, and carry out research that will increase your effectiveness in battle.
501304	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure you research upgrades that will increase both your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
501305	Take this battlefield, and the next, and the next after that. The fight will never end until your enemies are crushed.
501310	Take Cover
501311	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
501312	Cover hint
501313	Some types of terrain can provide your squads with protection from enemy fire. This is called Cover.
501314	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
501315	Cover is useful in that it can provide your squads with additional defensive bonuses, which make them harder to kill.
501316	It's easy to see Cover in the terrain -- just look for your mouse cursor to change as you pass over large bombed-out craters in cities, or patches of thick foliage in jungles.
501317	You'll notice that when you move your squads into an area of Cover, a small Cover icon will appear above them. This indicates they are receiving a defensive bonus.
501318	Excellent! Your squad is in Cover. Units in Cover are harder targets to shoot and take less damage from Ranged attacks because of this. Use Cover well to gain tactical advantages over your enemies.
501320	Very good! You are mastering advanced concepts that will help you to annihilate your enemies!
501321	Select a squad and take note of the small blue bar just under the squad's Health bar. This blue bar represents the Morale of your squad.
501322	Morale represents the effectiveness of your units in battle. Think of it as a combination of mental focus, courage, and the willingness to fight.
501323	Various weapons in the game inflict Morale damage as well as Health damage. When your squad takes Morale damage, the small blue bar will decrease, just like the Health bar does.
501324	When a squad's Morale becomes too low, the squad will break. A broken squad has lost the will to fight, and its combat effectiveness is drastically reduced.
501325	You do not lose control of broken squads. It is your choice whether to leave them in battle, or retreat to gather strength. Also, certain units have abilities that can increase the Morale of a squad.
501326	Morale can be an effective tool against your enemies.
501327	By destroying your enemy's Morale, you cause them to lose combat effectiveness, making them much easier to kill. In this way, a small but properly armed squad can destroy an enemy force of superior numbers.
501328	Remember, tactics and strategy can turn the tide of almost any battle. Make sure you use this knowledge to achieve victory on the battlefield!
501330	All units and vehicles have a Health rating. Health is represented by the small green bar underneath each squad or vehicle.
501331	Remember, a squad takes damage as a whole. When enough damage has been inflicted on the squad, a unit will die.
501332	If you lose any units during a fight, you can Reinforce to bring your squad back to full strength.
501333	Make sure you watch the strength of your squad in battle. Reinforce often, to make sure your squads are as effective as possible.
501334	Remember that when a unit with a heavy weapon dies, you lose that weapon from the squad. You will need to upgrade the squad to get the heavy weapon back.
501340	The diamond-shaped display in the lower left-hand corner of your screen is your Mini-map.
501341	The Mini-map provides important information that will help you win battles.
501342	You can use the Mini-map to see where your units and structures are located, to quickly scan the battlefield, to issue quick orders, and so on.
501343	Clicking anywhere in the Mini-map will move your camera to that location. This is useful when you need to survey the battlefield quickly, to make tactical decisions.
501344	Keep an eye on your Mini-map. It will help you see what is happening to units that you cannot currently see in your view screen.
501345	The Mini-map displays the locations of all Strategic Points on the battlefield, as well as other items of strategic importance.
501346	Fog of War prevents you from seeing things where you do not have a presence. As you move units into an area, the Fog of War will be lifted.
501347	When you have structures built in an area, the Fog of War in that area will remain revealed.
501350	Slag Deposits are concentrated points of energy hidden just under the planet's surface.
501351	Build a Bigga Generator on a Slag Deposit to access large amounts of the Power Resource.
501352	Take a quick look at your Mini-Map. There are dots on the map that represent Slag Deposits.
501353	Gretchin Squads can build Bigga Generators on Slag Deposits.
501360	Notice how each time a squad is Reinforced and a unit arrives, the squad rearranges itself to accomodate the new arrival. This is because squads work together as a unit.
501361	A squad responds to commands, such as move and attack, in harmony. This is the strength of the squad, and it allows you to control a large number of units on the battlefield more easily.
501370	Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requsition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
501380	Notice the white ring that appears around some of your structures when you are deciding where to build. This is the Control Zone.
501381	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Da Listening Posts, can be built at other locations.
501382	When you are trying to place a new structure, its colour changes from Red to Green as you move it around.
501383	A Green colour indicates that the structure can be placed at that location so that building will begin.
501390	Hide the Taskbar
501391	You can hide the taskbar by clicking on the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar. Try hiding the taskbar now.
501392	
501393	Hide the taskbar by clicking the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar.
501394	When the taskbar is hidden, you will notice the Mini-Map stays revealed.
501395	To issue commands and upgrade your squads you can either unhide the taskbar or use the 'hotkeys'.
501396	To return to the full taskbar, simply click the Skull icon again.
501400	Issue a Rally Point Command
501401	To issue a Rally Point command, select any building that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
501402	
501403	You've just issued a Rally Point command. You did this by selecting a structure capable of building squads or vehicles and right-clicking the ground nearby.
501404	Let's issue a Rally Point command.
501405	Select any structure that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
501406	When you issue a Rally Point command, you will notice a flag appears in the world. This flag will be visible whenever you have the structure selected.
501407	Any squads or vehicles that are built from that structure will automatically gather at the Rally Point when they are built.
501410	Now we will bring up the Objective Menu.
501411	The Objective Menu provides you a list of all the Primary and Secondary Objectives assigned to you by the game. Mouse over the Objectives to get the description of each.
501412	Excellent! Anytime you want to refer to the Objectives Menu, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
501413	Close the Objective Screen
501414	When you are familiar with the Objective Screen, click on the CLOSE button to return to the Tutorial.
501420	Build a Trukk
501421	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Trukk.
501422	
501423	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Trukk.
501424	The Trukk is the Ork's basic infantry transport. Exceptionally fast and well armoured, it is an excellent way to quickly move your infantry around the battlefield.
501425	Excellent! You now have a Trukk. You can try loading infantry into the Trukk by selecting the squad and right-clicking on it.
501426	To unload the squad, click on the Unload icon on the Trukk's taskbar.
501430	Build a Looted Tank
501431	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Looted Tank.
501432	
501433	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Looted Tank
501444	Looted Tank artillery vehicles have a devestating but inaccurate area attack that can send infantry flying and pound buildings into dust.
501445	Excellent! Your Looted Tank can attack like a normal unit, or you can click the Ground Attack icon on the Looted Tank's taskbar and left-click the battlefield to fire the artillery at a specific location.
501446	
501450	Build a Killa Kan
501451	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Killa Kan.
501452	
501453	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Killa Kan.
501454	Killa Kans are dangerous mechanical walkers. They are feared in close combat and can be upgraded to have powerful ranged attacks.
501455	Excellent! Your Killa Kan is a lethal killing machine that can break infantry Morale, crush vehicles and help you defeat your enemy.
501456	
501460	The Orks have many vehicle options. Upgrade your Settlement, capture Relics and stockpile Requisition and Power Resources to build them all.
501461	Don't forget to keep an eye on your Vehicle Cap. You cannot field more vehicles than you can support with your Vehicle Cap.
501470	Build a Waaagh! Banner
501471	Use a Gretchin Squad to build a Waaagh! Banner.
501472	
501473	Select a Gretchin Squad and build a Waaagh! Banner.
501474	The first step to gathering an Ork Mob is calling in the Orks.
501475	Waaagh! Banners provide many benefits to the Orks. They increase the rate of the Ork resource, they increase Squad and Vehicle Cap, and they can be upgraded for even better defense.
501476	Excellent! You have a Waaagh! Banner. Waaagh! Banners are key to the success of an Ork Mob. It never hurts to build more!
501477	
501480	Build a Warboss
501481	Select your Ork Settlement and build a Warboss.
501482	
501483	Select your Settlement and build a Warboss
501484	When you've amassed a sizeable number of Orks, it's time to call in a Warboss.
501485	The Warboss is the biggest and baddest of the Orks, and is significantly tougher than your average commander.
501486	Excellent! You have a Warboss. It's now time to lead the charge and destroy all that stand before you.
501487	
501490	Build a Squiggoth
501491	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Squiggoth.
501492	
501493	Select Da Mek Shop and build a Squiggoth.
501494	A proper Ork mob needs a proper transport.
501495	A Squiggoth is much more than just a transport. It is a devastating weapon platform and an unstoppable killing machine, just as able to eat an enemy squad as it is to trample it beneath its feet.
501496	Ahh the Squiggoth! The Squiggoth is nigh unstoppable. With its incredibly high Health and armour, it is the perfect beast for your Orks to rally around as they charge the enemy.
501497	
501500	The Ork race is all about the power of the Waaagh!, which is the power of the Ork Mob on the battlefield.
501501	The Orks rely on the number of Orks in the Mob, in addition to Researches and Add-ons, to unlock better and bigger units, weapons, and vehicles.
501502	In addition to Requisition and Power, the Orks have their own unique resource, called Ork Resource, increased by building Waaagh! Banners.
501503	Ork technology is dependent on the amount of Ork Resource plus the total Squad Cap. The more Orks you have, the better weapons your Mob can get their hands on.
501510	The Ork race is a brutal and savage one. Their lust for battle is quenched only by sinking their axe into an opponent's chest!
501511	In general, Orks are much better at Melee combat than they are at Ranged. Even the weakest Ork is better than a Space Marine when it comes to chopping.
501512	Because Orks like to charge into battle, they often take a lot of casualties from enemy fire. Because of this, it is especially important for Ork Squads to Reinforce to full strength.
501520	The Ork race achieves true domination through sheer numbers of Ork squads, with the support of Ork vehicles.
501521	Sometimes it is necessary to protect your Orks when your forces have not reached critical mass.
501522	Most Ork buildings allow you to Garrison Orks inside them, and since they are bristling with guns, this makes a very effective defense for your growing Ork mob.
501530	Gretchin Squads, or Grotz, can reinforce themselves for free and make a good distraction for enemy troops. Run Gretchin Squads ahead of your Orks as a meat shield, drawing enemy fire away from your bigger Orks.
501531	Don't expect Grotz to last long in combat, but the sacrifice can be well worth it.
501532	Grotz also decrease the time it takes to build structures, depending on how large your Gretchin Squad is.
502010	Welcome to the Dawn of War tutorial. By listening to me and reading the text that appears in this message box, you will learn how to play a Skirmish game.
502020	
502021	The mouse is your primary method of surveying the battle, selecting units and structures, and issuing orders.
502022	The mouse controls the camera. The camera represents your current view of the battlefield.
502030	Pan the camera using the mouse
502031	Use your mouse to control your view of the battlefield. You can pan by moving the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen.

502060	Reset the camera to default
502061	Press the 'Backspace' key on your keyboard to return the camera to the game's default view.
502062	hint text
502063	To return the camera to the game's default view, press the 'Backspace' key on your keyboard. Do this now.
502064	Excellent, you've returned the camera to its default playing view.
502065	By panning, rotating, and zooming the camera in and out, you can get whatever view of the battlefield you wish.
502070	Select the Webway Assembly
502071	Left-click the Webway Assembly to select it. Left-clicking on units and structures always selects them.
502072	hint text
502073	To select a unit or structure, simply click on it with the left mouse button. Go to your base and select the Webway Assembly.
502074	Congratulations! You have just learned how to select units and structures in the game.
502100	Build a Guardian Squad
502101	Select your Webway Assembly and build a Guardian Squad. Guardian Squads are always available from the Webway Assembly. They are the first step to securing Strategic Points and exploring.
502102	Guardian Squad hint text
502103	Select your Webway Assembly and look for the Guardian Squad icon located in the lower-right corner of the screen. Click this button now.
502104	Take note of the small bar that is gradually filling up. This Progress Bar gives you an indication of how close something is to being ready.
502105	Excellent! You now have a Guardian Squad.
502110	Capture a Strategic Point
502111	Use a Guardian Squad to capture a Strategic Point. Capturing and securing Strategic Points earns more Requisition Resource.
502112	Capture hint text
502113	Order the Guardian Squad to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
502114	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
502115	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
502116	Capturing a Strategic Point takes time. Do not move the capturing squad away from the Strategic Point until the progress bar is full. Otherwise, you will not take control of the Strategic Point.
502117	Excellent! The point is yours! You must continue to capture Strategic Points to get more Requisition Resource, which allows you to build more units and structures.
502120	Build a Bonesinger
502121	Use your Webway Assembly to build a Bonesinger. Bonesingers are required to build additional structures. Bonesingers are always available from the Webway Assembly.
502122	Bonesinger hint text
502123	Select your Webway Assembly and build a Bonesinger.
502124	Bonesingers are required to build additional structures. Bonesingers are always available from the Webway Assembly.
502125	The Bonesinger has arrived! Bonesingers are the Eldar builder unit. Any time you wish to build a new structure, you must use a Bonesinger.
502126	In order to further establish your base you need a Bonesinger.
502130	Build a Listening Shrine
502131	You must use your Bonesinger to build a Listening Shrine. Listening Shrines are a way of securing Strategic Points so they can not be taken, and increasing the amount of Requisition generated by the Strategic Point they are on.
502132	hint text
502133	Select the Bonesinger and build a Listening Shrine on the captured Strategic Point.
502134	The Listening Shrine fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
502135	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Listening Shrines on all your captured Strategic Points.
502140	Build an Aspect Portal
502141	Use your Bonesinger to build an Aspect Portal. Building an Aspect Portal unlocks new kinds of squads to build.
502142	Aspect Portal hint text
502143	Select your Bonesinger and build an Aspect Portal structure.
502144	The Aspect Portal is the structure where you can build more advanced Eldar infantry units.
502145	Excellent, the Aspect Portal is finished. The Aspect Portal grants access to the best of the Eldar infantry squads, as well as the Eldar's commander unit, the Farseer.
502150	Build a Ranger Squad
502151	Select your Aspect Portal and build a Ranger Squad. Ranger Squads are powerful and resilient, and with research they can be upgraded to counter almost any threat. They can also capture Strategic Points!
502152	
502153	Select your Aspect Portal and build a Ranger Squad. Ranger Squads are similar to the Space Marine Scout Squads, but their larger squad size and greater number of Long Rifles make them much more effective at breaking enemy Morale.
502154	Excellent! Ranger Squads can be devastating to enemy Morale but do not stand up well to intense enemy fire. They are best used for stealth, support, and for capturing Strategic Points.
502160	Build a Farseer
502161	Select the Aspect Portal and build a Farseer. The Farseer is much more powerful than your average warrior and acts as a hero for your army. You can upgrade her with powerful abilities through research available later in the tech tree.
502162	hint text
502163	Select the Aspect Portal and build a Farseer. The Farseer acts as a hero for your army.
502164	The Farseer is a powerful psychic. While her physical attacks are not as powerful as those of other commanders, her psychic abilities more than make up for this. She will lead your force to victory.
502165	Excellent! The Farseer has arrived. The Farseer cannot capture points but is a gifted psychic with many powerful abilities, gaining even more with research.
502170	Attach your Farseer to a squad
502171	Select your Farseer, click the Attach button, and select the squad you want to attach him to.
502172	hint text
502173	Select your Farseer and click the Attach button. Now, select a Ranger Squad.
502174	Excellent! Notice how when the Farseer joins the squad, they rearrange themselves to make room for their esteemed leader.
502175	
502176	To detach the leader from this squad, simply select the squad, then click the Detach icon. It is located in the same place as the Attach icon.
502180	Build a Soul Shrine
502181	Use your Bonesinger to build a Soul Shrine.
502182	
502183	Select your Bonesinger and build a Soul Shrine. This is how you advance the Eldar technology level.
502184	The Soul Shrine is a research facility. Building it allows you to unlock a great number of new units and abilities.
502185	Excellent! The Soul Shrine is complete. This signifies the Eldar are ready for the next stage of their preparations for war.
502186	
502190	Add a Warlock to your Ranger Squad
502191	Some squads, like Ranger Squads, can add a Leader. Warlocks provide an excellent boost to the squad's morale. Select a squad, then click the Add Leader: Warlock icon to build a Warlock.
502192	
502193	Select a Ranger Squad and click the Add Leader: Warlock icon.
502194	Warlocks are valiant leaders that improve the combat ability and morale of the squad they are part of.  They will inspire your Eldar to greater feats of heroism.
502195	Excellent! Your Warlock has arrived. Note that your Warlocks are part of the squad and cannot leave it.
502200	Research Mobilize for War
502201	To reach the next level of technology and the ability to build vehicles, you must select the Soul Shrine and research Mobilize for War.
502202	
502203	To reach the stage where we can build vehicles, we must first research Mobilize for War located on the Soul Shrine.
502204	Excellent! The research is complete. You now have access to the Eldar vehicle structure.
502220	Build a Plasma Generator
502221	Use your Bonesinger to build a Plasma Generator. Plasma Generators provide the Power you need for your special units, weaponry, vehicles, structures, and abilities. Power is the second resource you must manage in Dawn of War.
502222	hint text
502223	Select your Bonesinger and build a Plasma Generator.
502224	Some structures, vehicles, and research require Power to function. Building a Plasma Generator will supply you with the Power you need to keep your force going.
502225	The more Plasma Generators you have, the faster you will build up the Power Resource.
502226	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Webway Assembly.
502227	
502230	Reinforce your Ranger Squad
502231	Use the Reinforce function to add units to your Ranger Squad. You can Reinforce anywhere in the battlefield to replenish your squads if some of your units fall in battle.
502232	hint text
502233	Select a Ranger Squad. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
502234	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.
502235	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that one of your Eldar warriors is killed by the enemy.
502236	You can click the Reinforce Squad button multiple times to bring the squad to full strength.
502237	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Ranger Squad.
502240	Build and upgrade another Ranger Squad
502241	Build another Ranger Squad, Reinforce it to full strength, Upgrade it with 2 special weapons, and Add a Leader.
502242	hint text
502243	Select your Aspect Portal and build another Ranger Squad.
502244	Your field base has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
502245	You can see your current Squad Cap in the Resource Area at the top of your screen.
502246	Once you have reached your maximum Squad Cap, you will not be able to call in any additional squads, so it's very important to keep an eye on this as you're building up your forces.
502247	You can increase your Squad Cap by building certain structures and researching upgrades, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
502248	Excellent! You have built a Ranger Squad and brought it to full strength. To mount an effective attack, you should try to have several Ranger Squads, fully Reinforced to maximum strength and Upgraded with special weapons and a Warlock.
502250	Capture and Secure more Strategic Points
502251	To make sure you have enough of your main resource, Requisition, you need to capture and secure more Strategic Points. Capture 3 Strategic Points and build Listening Shrines on them.
502252	hint text
502253	Explore the map around your base with your Ranger Squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must Capture 3 Strategic Points.
502254	The best way to make sure you have enough Requisition Resource is to capture and secure Strategic Points.
502255	
502256	Make sure you use your Bonesinger to build Listening Shrines on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
502257	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Listening Shrines on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
502260	Capture a Critical Location
502261	Critical Locations are points on the map that represent areas of critical strategic importance. In some multiplayer games, capturing one or more of these points can win you the game. Capture one now.
502262	hint text
502263	Use a squad to capture a Critical Location. Critical Locations are points on the map that represent locations of critical strategic importance.
502264	You can capture Critical Locations just like Strategic Points. In some multiplayer games, capturing and holding one or more of these Critical Locations can win you the game! You also get Requisition from any Critical Locations you control.
502265	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Listening Shrines built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
502270	Capture a Relic
502271	Relics are sacred points of great value. Holding Relics will allow you access to your army's best units and vehicles.
502272	hint text
502273	Use a squad to capture a Relic. Relics are sacred points of great value.
502274	Holding Relics gives you access to your army's best units and vehicles. Hold on to them to ensure you have access to your best technology!
502275	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Listening Shrines to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
502280	Build a Support Portal
502281	Use your Bonesinger to build a Support Portal. The Support Portal is used to build vehicles.
502282	hint text
502283	Use your Bonesinger to build a Support Portal.
502284	The Support Portal is the vehicle-producing structure for the Eldar race. Just like the Aspect Portal, it too has Aspect Stone Add-ons that must be researched to unlock vehicles.
502285	Vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. They are a fundamental part of your army, and can carry powerful support weapons.
502286	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap. Just like Squad Cap, once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can research technology at your Webway Assembly that will increase your Vehicle Cap.
502287	Excellent! You now have a Support Portal. You can build powerful vehicles from this building.
502290	To increase the number of squads you can field in Dawn of War, you click on the research items located on your Webway Assembly.
502291	You've reached the maximum number of squads you're allowed to field. Be sure to Reinforce your squads to full strength to get the most out of them. If you have invested unwisely, you can press the 'Delete' button on your keyboard to terminate unwanted squads.
502300	Congratulations! You've completed the learning session of the tutorial.
502301	It is time to put what you have learned to work. Take control of the force and build up your strength so you can crush your enemy!
502302	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points, and Bonesingers to build Listening Shrines on them.
502303	Continue to build structures, and carry out research that will increase your effectiveness in battle.
502304	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure you research upgrades that will increase both your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
502305	Take this battlefield, and the next, and the next after that. The fight will never end until your enemies are crushed.
502310	Take Cover
502311	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
502312	Cover hint
502313	Some types of terrain can provide your squads with protection from enemy fire. This is called Cover.
502314	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
502315	Cover is useful in that it can provide your squads with additional defensive bonuses, which make them harder to kill.
502316	It's easy to see Cover in the terrain -- just look for your mouse cursor to change as you pass over large bombed-out craters in cities, or patches of thick foliage in jungles.
502317	You'll notice that when you move your squads into an area of Cover, a small Cover icon will appear above them. This indicates they are receiving a defensive bonus.
502318	Excellent! Your squad is in Cover. Units in Cover are harder targets to shoot and take less damage from Ranged attacks because of this. Use Cover well to gain tactical advantages over your enemies.
502320	Very good! You are mastering advanced concepts that will help you to annihilate your enemies!
502321	Select a squad and take note of the small blue bar just under the squad's Health bar. This blue bar represents the Morale of your squad.
502322	Morale represents the effectiveness of your units in battle. Think of it as a combination of mental focus, courage, and the willingness to fight.
502323	Various weapons in the game inflict Morale damage as well as Health damage. When your squad takes Morale damage, the small blue bar will decrease, just like the Health bar does.
502324	When a squad's Morale becomes too low, the squad will break. A broken squad has lost the will to fight, and its combat effectiveness is drastically reduced.
502325	You do not lose control of broken squads. It is your choice whether to leave them in battle, or retreat to gather strength. Also, certain units have abilities that can increase the Morale of a squad.
502326	Morale can be an effective tool against your enemies.
502327	By destroying your enemy's Morale, you cause them to lose combat effectiveness, making them much easier to kill. In this way, a small but properly armed squad can destroy an enemy force of superior numbers.
502328	Remember, tactics and strategy can turn the tide of almost any battle. Make sure you use this knowledge to achieve victory on the battlefield!
502330	All units and vehicles have a Health rating. Health is represented by the small green bar underneath each squad or vehicle.
502331	Remember, a squad takes damage as a whole. When enough damage has been inflicted on the squad, a unit will die.
502332	If you lose any units during a fight, you can Reinforce to bring your squad back to full strength.
502333	Make sure you watch the strength of your squad in battle. Reinforce often, to make sure your squads are as effective as possible.
502334	Remember that when a unit with a heavy weapon dies, you lose that weapon from the squad. You will need to upgrade the squad to get the heavy weapon back.
502340	The diamond-shaped display in the lower left-hand corner of your screen is your Mini-map.
502341	The Mini-map provides important information that will help you win battles.
502342	You can use the Mini-map to see where your units and structures are located, to quickly scan the battlefield, to issue quick orders, and so on.
502343	Clicking anywhere in the Mini-map will move your camera to that location. This is useful when you need to survey the battlefield quickly, to make tactical decisions.
502344	Keep an eye on your Mini-map. It will help you see what is happening to units that you cannot currently see in your view screen.
502345	The Mini-map displays the locations of all Strategic Points on the battlefield, as well as other items of strategic importance.
502346	Fog of War prevents you from seeing things where you do not have a presence. As you move units into an area, the Fog of War will be lifted.
502347	When you have structures built in an area, the Fog of War in that area will remain revealed.
502350	Slag Deposits are concentrated points of energy hidden just under the planet's surface.
502351	Build a Thermo-Plasma Generator on a Slag Deposit to access large amounts of the Power Resource.
502352	Take a quick look at your Mini-Map. There are dots on the map that represent Slag Deposits.
502353	Bonesingers can build Thermo-Plasma Generators on Slag Deposits.
502360	Notice how each time a squad is Reinforced and a unit arrives, the squad rearranges itself to accomodate the new arrival. This is because squads work together as a unit.
502361	A squad responds to commands, such as move and attack, in harmony. This is the strength of the squad, and it allows you to control a large number of units on the battlefield more easily.
502370	Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requsition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
502380	Notice the white ring that appears around some of your structures when you are deciding where to build. This is the Control Zone.
502381	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Listening Shrines, can be built at other locations.
502382	When you are trying to place a new structure, its colour changes from Red to Green as you move it around.
502383	A Green colour indicates that the structure can be placed at that location so that building will begin.
502390	Hide the Taskbar
502391	You can hide the taskbar by clicking on the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar. Try hiding the taskbar now.
502392	
502393	Hide the taskbar by clicking the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar.
502394	When the taskbar is hidden, you will notice the Mini-Map stays revealed.
502395	To issue commands and upgrade your squads you can either unhide the taskbar or use the 'hotkeys'.
502396	To return to the full taskbar, simply click the Skull icon again.
502400	Issue a Rally Point Command
502401	To issue a Rally Point command, select any building that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
502402	
502403	You've just issued a Rally Point command. You did this by selecting a structure capable of building squads or vehicles and right-clicking the ground nearby.
502404	Let's issue a Rally Point command.
502405	Select any structure that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
502406	When you issue a Rally Point command, you will notice a flag appears in the world. This flag will be visible whenever you have the structure selected.
502407	Any squads or vehicles that are built from that structure will automatically gather at the Rally Point when they are built.
502410	Now we will bring up the Objective Menu.
502411	The Objective Menu provides you a list of all the Primary and Secondary Objectives assigned to you by the game. Mouse over the Objectives to get the description of each.
502412	Excellent! Anytime you want to refer to the Objectives Menu, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
502413	Close the Objective Screen
502414	When you are familiar with the Objective Screen, click on the CLOSE button to return to the Tutorial.

502421	Select your Support Portal and build a Falcon Grav Tank.
502422	
502423	Select your Support Portal and build a Falcon Grav Tank.
502424	The Falcon Grav Tank is the Eldar's basic infantry transport. Exceptionally fast and well armoured, it is an excellent way to quickly move your infantry around the battlefield.
502425	Excellent! You now have a Falcon Grav Tank. You can try loading infantry into the Falcon Grav Tank by selecting the squad and right-clicking on it.
502426	To unload the squad, click on the Unload icon on the Falcon Grav Tank's taskbar.
502430	Build a Fire Prism
502431	Select your Support Portal and build a Fire Prism.
502432	
502433	Select your Support Portal and build a Fire Prism.
502444	Fire Prism artillery vehicles have a devestating but inaccurate area attack that can send infantry flying and pound buildings into dust.
502445	Excellent! Your Fire Prism can attack like a normal unit, or you can click the Ground Attack icon on the Fire Prism's taskbar and left-click the battlefield to fire the artillery at a specific location.
502446	
502450	Build a Wraithlord
502451	Select your Support Portal and build a Wraithlord.
502452	
502453	Select your Support Portal and build a Wraithlord.
502454	Wraithlords are dangerous mechanical walkers. They are feared in close combat and can be upgraded to have powerful ranged attacks.
502455	Excellent! Your Wraithlord is a lethal killing machine that can break infantry Morale, crush vehicles and help you defeat your enemy.
502456	
502460	The Eldar have many vehicle options. Upgrade your Webway Assembly, capture Relics and stockpile Requisition and Power Resources to build them all.
502461	Don't forget to keep an eye on your Vehicle Cap. You cannot field more vehicles than you can support with your Vehicle Cap.
502510	Eldar infantry are very different than the other races in Dawn of War.
502511	Different types of Eldar infantry specialize in countering various threats.
502512	Some Eldar infantry require you to research Aspect Stones first. Aspect Stones only unlock the associated infantry type at the Aspect Portal where they are researched, not globally across all portals.
502520	Build a Webway Gate
502521	Select a Bonesinger and build a Webway Gate.
502522	
502523	Select a Bonesinger and build a Webway Gate.
502524	Eldar depend on Webway Gates for many reasons: they expand the Control Zone, they add to the Squad and Vehicle Cap, and they allow for the fast relocation of infantry squads.
502525	Excellent! The Webway Gate is finished. You must build Webway Gates to support your army.
502526	
502527	You can garrison infantry inside a Webway Gate by selecting any squad and right-clicking on the gate. You can then unload the squad from ANY other gate on the battlefield by clicking the Unload icon on any selected Webway Gate.
502528	Webway Gates can build Grav Platforms. Grav Platforms function as moveable turrets and the Brightlance Grav Platform is excellent against vehicles.
502529	
502530	If you select the Aspect Portal you will notice several different types of Add-on's, called Aspect Stones.
502531	Certain special Eldar infantry squad types must be unlocked by researching these Aspect Stones.
502532	
502540	Build a Howling Banshee Squad
502541	Select the Aspect Portal and research the Banshee Aspect Stone Add-on. When that is finished you can build a Howling Banshee Squad from that Aspect Portal.

502554	The Dark Reapers are deadly long-range marksmen that excel at killing heavily armoured infantry like the mighty Space Marines.
502555	Excellent! Dark Reapers are ideal for ranged attacks on heavy infantry like Space Marine Squads and Terminators.
502556	
502560	Build a Warp Spider Squad
502561	Select the Aspect Portal and research the Spider Aspect Stone Add-on. When that is finished you can build a Warp Spider Squad from that Aspect Portal.
502562	
502563	Let's build a Warp Spider Squad from the Aspect Portal by researching the Warp Spider Aspect Stone Add-on and then building a Warp Spider Squad.
502564	The Warp Spiders have powerful teleporters integrated into their armour that allow them to teleport quickly about the map.
502565	In addition to the Warp Spider Squads' main use as a light infantry counter, they can be upgraded to handle vehicles and destroy buildings.
502566	Excellent! Warp Spider Squads are best at dealing death to light infantry like Ork Slugga Boyz and Cultists.
502567	
502570	The Eldar are a very mobile race.
502571	Many Eldar infantry have the Fleet of Foot ability that grants them greater speed over long distances.
502572	Most Eldar vehicles, the Warp Spider Squads, and even the Webway Gates allow for various forms of Jumping and Teleportation. The Eldar excel at moving quickly around the battlefield.
502573	
502574	
502575	
502576	
502580	Build an Avatar
502581	The Avatar is a living god for the Eldar race. The Avatar is built from the Aspect Portal. To build the Avatar you must research ALL of the Aspect Stone Add-ons on both the Aspect Portal and the Support Portal.
502582	
502583	Let's build an Avatar. You must first research all of the Aspect Stone Add-ons on the Aspect Portal and Support Portal. When that is complete, select the Aspect Portal and build the Avatar.
502585	The Avatar costs a significant amount of resources but is well worth it for its strength in combat.
502586	Excellent! The Avatar is finished. The Avatar is the Eldar's ultimate living weapon. It will destroy all in its path. Go forth and conquer.
503010	Welcome to the Dawn of War tutorial. By listening to me and reading the text that appears in this message box, you will learn how to play a Skirmish game.
503020	
503021	The mouse is your primary method of surveying the battle, selecting units and structures, and issuing orders.
503022	The mouse controls the camera. The camera represents your current view of the battlefield.
503030	Pan the camera using the mouse

503105	Excellent! You now have a Cultist Squad.
503110	Capture a Strategic Point
503111	Use a Cultist Squad to capture a Strategic Point. Capturing and securing Strategic Points earns more Requisition.
503112	Capture hint text
503113	Order the Cultist Squad to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
503114	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
503115	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
503116	Capturing a Strategic Point takes time. Do not move the capturing squad away from the Strategic Point until the progress bar is full. Otherwise, you will not take control of the Strategic Point.
503117	Excellent! The point is ours! You must continue to capture Strategic Points to get more Requisition Resource, which allows you to build more units and structures.
503120	Build a Heretic
503121	Use your Desecrated Stronghold to build a Heretic. Heretics are required to build additional structures. Heretics are always available from the Desecrated Stronghold.
503122	Heretic hint text
503123	Select your Desecrated Stronghold and build a Heretic.
503124	Heretics are required to build additional structures. Heretics are always available from the Desecrated Stronghold.
503125	The Heretic has arrived! Heretics are the Chaos' builder unit. Any time you wish to build a new structure, you must use a Heretic.
503126	In order to further establish your base you need a Heretic.
503130	Build a Listening Post
503131	You must use your Heretic to build a Listening Post. Listening Posts are a way of securing Strategic Points so they can not be taken, and increasing the amount of Requisition generated by the Strategic Point they are on.
503132	hint text
503133	Select the Heretic and build a Listening Post on the captured Strategic Point.
503134	The Listening Post fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
503135	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Listening Posts on all your captured Strategic Points.
503140	Build a Chaos Temple
503141	Use your Heretic to build a Chaos Temple. The Chaos Temple is used to build Chaos Space Marines, who will form the backbone of your army. Creating a Chaos Temple will also unlock new kinds of squads and buildings.
503142	Chaos Temple hint text
503143	Select your Heretic and build a Chaos Temple structure.
503144	The Chaos Temple is the structure where you can build more advanced Chaos infantry units.
503145	Excellent, the Chaos Temple is finished.
503150	Build a Chaos Space Marine Squad
503151	Select your Chaos Temple and build a Chaos Space Marine Squad. Chaos Space Marine Squads are powerful and resilient, and with research they can be upgraded to counter almost any threat. They can also capture Strategic Points!
503152	
503153	Select your Chaos Temple and build a Chaos Space Marine Squad. These elite warriors will form the core of your military force.
503154	Excellent! Chaos Space Marine Squads are your all-purpose fighting force. They are powerful and resilient and, with research, can be upgraded to counter almost any threat. They can also capture Strategic Points!
503160	Build a Chaos Lord
503161	Select the Chaos Temple and build a Chaos Lord. The Chaos Lord is much more powerful than your average warrior and acts as a hero for your army. You can upgrade him with powerful abilities through research available later in the tech tree.
503162	hint text

503172	hint text
503173	Select your Chaos Lord and click the Attach button. Now, select a Chaos Space Marine Squad.
503174	Notice how when the Chaos Lord joins the squad, they rearrange themselves to make room for their esteemed leader.
503175	This Chaos Space Marine Squad is greatly enhanced by the addition of the Chaos Lord, but he can also fight effectively on his own.
503176	To detach the leader from this squad, simply select the squad, then click the Detach icon. It is located in the same place as the Attach icon.
503180	Upgrade the Desecrated Stronghold
503181	It is time to upgrade the Desecrated Stronghold, your headquarters. By researching the Desecrated Fortress upgrade, you will gain access to Squad Leaders for your Chaos Space Marine Squads and better weapons from the Chaos Armory.
503182	
503183	Select the Desecrated Stronghold and click the Desecrated Fortress Upgrade icon.
503184	We must upgrade the Desecrated Stronghold to a Desecrated Fortress to gain access to Squad Leaders and other powerful research options and structures.
503185	Leaders are highly skilled warriors that can be added to some Chaos Space Marine Squads. You will need strong leaders if you are to defeat your enemies.
503186	The Desecrated Fortress is complete! You can now add Aspiring Champions to your Chaos Space Marine Squads.
503190	Add an Aspiring Champion to your Chaos Space Marine Squad
503191	Some squads, like Chaos Space Marine Squads, can add a Leader. Aspiring Champions provide an excellent boost to the squad's morale. Select a squad, then click the Add Leader: Aspiring Champion icon to build an Aspiring Champion.
503192	
503193	Select a Chaos Space Marine Squad and click the Add Leader: Aspiring Champion icon.
503194	Aspiring Champions are valiant leaders that improve the combat ability and morale of the squad they are part of.  They will inspire your Marines to greater feats of heroism.
503195	Excellent! Your Aspiring Champion has arrived. Note that your Aspiring Champion is part of the squad and cannot leave it.
503200	Build a Chaos Armory
503201	You must use your Heretic to build a Chaos Armory. Once complete, the Chaos Armory will grant you access to special weapons for your squads.
503202	
503203	Select your Heretic and build a Chaos Armory now.
503204	You must build a Chaos Armory in order to access weapon upgrades. Squads can be equipped with a variety of weaponry, allowing you to prepare them against different enemy types.
503205	
503206	Excellent, the Chaos Armory is operational.
503210	Upgrade your Chaos Space Marine Squad's weaponry
503211	The Chaos Armory unlocks access to heavy weaponry for your infantry squads. Upgrade a Chaos Space Marine Squad with Heavy Bolters.
503212	Upgrade Weaponry hint
503213	Select your Chaos Space Marine Squad and click the Upgrade: Heavy Bolter icon to upgrade a squad member.
503214	Notice a Heavy Bolter appears in one of your squad member's hands. This procedure can be performed with any of the available weapon upgrades.
503215	Initially you can only upgrade 2 units of your total squad with heavy weapons. By doing further research at the Chaos Armory you can unlock the capability to upgrade more.
503216	Excellent. You have upgraded your Chaos Space Marine Squad. You can upgrade your squads anywhere on the battlefield to weapons that are well suited to counter your enemy.
503220	Build a Plasma Generator
503221	Use your Heretic to build a Plasma Generator. Plasma Generators provide the Power you need for your special units, weaponry, vehicles, structures, and abilities. Power is the second resource you must manage in Dawn of War.
503222	hint text
503223	Select your Heretic and build a Plasma Generator.
503224	Some structures, vehicles, and research require Power to function. Building a Plasma Generator will supply you with the Power you need to keep your force going.
503225	The more Plasma Generators you have, the faster you will build up the Power Resource.
503226	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Desecrated Stronghold.
503227	
503230	Reinforce your Chaos Space Marine Squad
503231	Use the Reinforce function to add units to your Chaos Space Marine Squad. You can Reinforce anywhere in the battlefield to replenish your squads if some of your units fall in battle.
503232	hint text
503233	Select a Chaos Space Marine Squad. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
503234	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.
503235	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a Chaos Space Marine falls to the enemy.
503236	You can click the Reinforce Squad button multiple times to bring the squad to full strength.
503237	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Chaos Space Marine Squad.
503240	Build and upgrade another Chaos Space Marine Squad
503241	Build another Chaos Space Marine Squad, Reinforce it to full strength, Upgrade it with 2 special weapons, and Add a Leader.
503242	hint text
503243	Select your Chaos Temple and build another Chaos Space Marine Squad.
503244	Your field base has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
503245	You can see your current Squad Cap in the Resource Area at the top of your screen.
503246	Once you have reached your maximum Squad Cap, you will not be able to call in any additional squads, so it's very important to keep an eye on this as you're building up your forces.
503247	You can increase your Squad Cap by building certain structures and researching upgrades, but there is always a maximum beyond which you cannot go.
503248	Excellent! You have built a Chaos Space Marine Squad and brought it to full strength. To mount an effective attack, you should try to have several Chaos Space Marine Squads, fully Reinforced to maximum strength and Upgraded with special weapons and an Aspiring Champion.
503250	Capture and Secure more Strategic Points
503251	To make sure you have enough of your main resource, Requisition, you need to capture and secure more Strategic Points. Capture 3 Strategic Points and build Listening Posts on them.
503252	hint text
503253	Explore the map around your base with your Chaos Space Marine Squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must Capture 3 Strategic Points.
503254	The best way to make sure you have enough Requisition Resource is to capture and secure Strategic Points.
503255	
503256	Make sure you use your Heretic to build Listening Posts on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
503257	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Listening Posts on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
503260	Capture a Critical Location
503261	Critical Locations are points on the map that represent areas of critical strategic importance. In some multiplayer games, capturing one or more of these points can win you the game. Capture one now.
503262	hint text
503263	Use a squad to capture a Critical Location. Critical Locations are points on the map that represent locations of critical strategic importance.
503264	You can capture Critical Locations just like Strategic Points. In some multiplayer games, capturing and holding one or more of these Critical Locations can win you the game! You also get Requisition from any Critical Locations you control.
503265	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Listening Posts built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
503270	Capture a Relic
503271	Relics are sacred points of great value. Holding Relics will allow you access to your army's best units and vehicles.
503272	hint text
503273	Use a squad to capture a Relic. Relics are sacred points of great value.
503274	Holding Relics gives you access to your army's best units and vehicles. Hold on to them to ensure you have access to your best technology!
503275	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Listening Posts to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
503280	Build a Machine Pit
503281	Use your Heretic to build a Machine Pit. The Machine Pit is used to build vehicles. Vehicles are tough and much stronger than non-upgraded infantry.
503282	hint text
503283	Use your Heretic to build a Machine Pit.
503284	Just like the Chaos Temple is used to build infantry units, the Machine Pit is used to build vehicles.
503285	Vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. They are a fundamental part of your army, and can carry powerful support weapons.
503286	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap. Just like Squad Cap, once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can research technology at your Desecrated Stronghold that will increase your Vehicle Cap.
503287	Excellent! You now have a Machine Pit. You can build powerful vehicles from this building.
503290	To increase the number of squads you can field in Dawn of War, you click on the research items located on your Desecrated Stronghold.
503291	You've reached the maximum number of squads you're allowed to field. Be sure to Reinforce your squads to full strength to get the most out of them. If you have invested unwisely, you can press the 'Delete' button on your keyboard to terminate unwanted squads.
503300	Congratulations! You've completed the learning session of the tutorial.
503301	It is time to put what you have learned to work. Take control of the force and build up your strength so you can crush your enemy!
503302	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points, and Heretics to build Listening Posts on them.
503303	Continue to build structures, and carry out research that will increase your effectiveness in battle.
503304	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure you research upgrades that will increase both your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
503305	Take this battlefield, and the next, and the next after that. The fight will never end until your enemies are crushed.
503310	Take Cover
503311	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
503312	Cover hint
503313	Some types of terrain can provide your squads with protection from enemy fire. This is called Cover.
503314	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
503315	Cover is useful in that it can provide your squads with additional defensive bonuses, which make them harder to kill.
503316	It's easy to see Cover in the terrain -- just look for your mouse cursor to change as you pass over large bombed-out craters in cities, or patches of thick foliage in jungles.
503317	You'll notice that when you move your squads into an area of Cover, a small Cover icon will appear above them. This indicates they are receiving a defensive bonus.
503318	Excellent! Your squad is in Cover. Units in Cover are harder targets to shoot and take less damage from Ranged attacks because of this. Use Cover well to gain tactical advantages over your enemies.
503320	Very good! You are mastering advanced concepts that will help you to annihilate your enemies!
503321	Select a squad and take note of the small blue bar just under the squad's Health bar. This blue bar represents the Morale of your squad.
503322	Morale represents the effectiveness of your units in battle. Think of it as a combination of mental focus, courage, and the willingness to fight.
503323	Various weapons in the game inflict Morale damage as well as Health damage. When your squad takes Morale damage, the small blue bar will decrease, just like the Health bar does.
503324	When a squad's Morale becomes too low, the squad will break. A broken squad has lost the will to fight, and its combat effectiveness is drastically reduced.
503325	You do not lose control of broken squads. It is your choice whether to leave them in battle, or retreat to gather strength. Also, certain units have abilities that can increase the Morale of a squad.
503326	Morale can be an effective tool against your enemies.
503327	By destroying your enemy's Morale, you cause them to lose combat effectiveness, making them much easier to kill. In this way, a small but properly armed squad can destroy an enemy force of superior numbers.
503328	Remember, tactics and strategy can turn the tide of almost any battle. Make sure you use this knowledge to achieve victory on the battlefield!
503330	All units and vehicles have a Health rating. Health is represented by the small green bar underneath each squad or vehicle.
503331	Remember, a squad takes damage as a whole. When enough damage has been inflicted on the squad, a unit will die.
503332	If you lose any units during a fight, you can Reinforce to bring your squad back to full strength.
503333	Make sure you watch the strength of your squad in battle. Reinforce often, to make sure your squads are as effective as possible.
503334	Remember that when a unit with a heavy weapon dies, you lose that weapon from the squad. You will need to upgrade the squad to get the heavy weapon back.
503340	The diamond-shaped display in the lower left-hand corner of your screen is your Mini-map.
503341	The Mini-map provides important information that will help you win battles.
503342	You can use the Mini-map to see where your units and structures are located, to quickly scan the battlefield, to issue quick orders, and so on.
503343	Clicking anywhere in the Mini-map will move your camera to that location. This is useful when you need to survey the battlefield quickly, to make tactical decisions.
503344	Keep an eye on your Mini-map. It will help you see what is happening to units that you cannot currently see in your view screen.
503345	The Mini-map displays the locations of all Strategic Points on the battlefield, as well as other items of strategic importance.
503346	Fog of War prevents you from seeing things where you do not have a presence. As you move units into an area, the Fog of War will be lifted.
503347	When you have structures built in an area, the Fog of War in that area will remain revealed.
503350	Slag Deposits are concentrated points of energy hidden just under the planet's surface.
503351	Build a Thermo-Plasma Generator on a Slag Deposit to access large amounts of the Power Resource.
503352	Take a quick look at your Mini-Map. There are dots on the map that represent Slag Deposits.
503353	Heretics can build Thermo-Plasma Generators on Slag Deposits.
503360	Notice how each time a squad is Reinforced and a unit arrives, the squad rearranges itself to accomodate the new arrival. This is because squads work together as a unit.
503361	A squad responds to commands, such as move and attack, in harmony. This is the strength of the squad, and it allows you to control a large number of units on the battlefield more easily.
503370	Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requsition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
503380	Notice the white ring that appears around some of your structures when you are deciding where to build. This is the Control Zone.
503381	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Listening Posts, can be built at other locations.
503382	When you are trying to place a new structure, its colour changes from Red to Green as you move it around.
503383	A Green colour indicates that the structure can be placed at that location so that building will begin.
503390	Hide the Taskbar
503391	You can hide the taskbar by clicking on the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar. Try hiding the taskbar now.
503392	
503393	Hide the taskbar by clicking the Skull icon on the upper-middle edge of the taskbar.
503394	When the taskbar is hidden, you will notice the Mini-Map stays revealed.
503395	To issue commands and upgrade your squads you can either unhide the taskbar or use the 'hotkeys'.
503396	To return to the full taskbar, simply click the Skull icon again.
503400	Issue a Rally Point Command
503401	To issue a Rally Point command, select any building that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
503402	
503403	You've just issued a Rally Point command. You did this by selecting a structure capable of building squads or vehicles and right-clicking the ground nearby.
503404	Let's issue a Rally Point command.
503405	Select any structure that is capable of producing squads or vehicles and right-click the ground nearby.
503406	When you issue a Rally Point command, you will notice a flag appears in the world. This flag will be visible whenever you have the structure selected.
503407	Any squads or vehicles that are built from that structure will automatically gather at the Rally Point when they are built.
503410	Now we will bring up the Objective Menu.
503411	The Objective Menu provides you a list of all the Primary and Secondary Objectives assigned to you by the game. Mouse over the Objectives to get the description of each.
503412	Excellent! Anytime you want to refer to the Objectives Menu, click on the OBJ button on the upper menu bar.
503413	Close the Objective Screen
503414	When you are familiar with the Objective Screen, click on the CLOSE button to return to the Tutorial.
503420	Build a Chaos Rhino Transport
503421	Select your Machine Pit and build a Chaos Rhino Transport.
503422	
503423	Select your Machine Pit and build a Chaos Rhino Transport.
503424	The Chaos Rhino Transport is the Chaos's basic infantry transport. Exceptionally fast and well armoured, it is an excellent way to quickly move your infantry around the battlefield.
503425	Excellent! You now have a Rhino. You can try loading infantry into the Chaos Rhino Transport by selecting the squad and right-clicking on it.
503426	To unload the squad, click on the Unload icon on the Chaos Rhino Transport's taskbar.
503430	Build a Defiler
503431	Select your Machine Pit and build a Defiler.
503432	
503433	Select your Machine Pit and build a Defiler.
503444	Defiler artillery vehicles have a devestating but inaccurate area attack that can send infantry flying and pound buildings into dust.
503445	Excellent! Your Defiler can attack like a normal unit, or you can click the Ground Attack icon on the Defiler's taskbar and left-click the battlefield to fire the artillery at a specific location.
503446	
503450	Build a Defiler
503451	Select your Machine Pit and build a Defiler.
503452	
503453	Select your Machine Pit and build a Defiler.
503454	Defilers are dangerous mechanical walkers. They are feared in close combat and can be upgraded to have powerful ranged attacks.
503455	Excellent! Your Defiler is a lethal killing machine that can break infantry Morale, crush vehicles and help you defeat your enemy.
503456	
503460	The Chaos have many vehicle options. Upgrade your Desecrated Stronghold, capture Relics and stockpile Requisition and Power Resources to build them all.
503461	Don't forget to keep an eye on your Vehicle Cap. You cannot field more vehicles than you can support with your Vehicle Cap.
503470	The evil essence of Chaos seeps into everything they touch.
503471	Chaos structures are surrounded by a corrupting miasma known as the Chaos Taint, which reduces the morale recovery of enemy units and heals friendly units.
503480	Build a Sacrificial Circle
503481	Select a Heretic and build a Sacrificial Circle.
503482	
503483	To get your first taste of Chaos daemons, get your Heretic to build a Sacrificial Circle.
503484	A Sacrificial Circle is like a second barracks, but for daemonic forces instead of mortal men.
503485	The Sacrificial Circle is a mark of true devotion to the Dark Gods. Through it you can summon Horrors, enlist squads of Possessed Marines and unlock your second commander unit.
503486	
503490	Summon a Horror Squad
503491	Chaos has special ways of getting squads out into the field. To Summon a Horror Squad, you must first select the Sacrificial Circle and build it like any other infantry squad. Once it is complete, the Summon Daemon icon will be available. To Summon the Horror Squad, click the icon and then click any visible location on the battlefield.
503492	
503493	It is time to Summon some daemons. Select the Sacrificial Circle and begin by building a Horror Squad.
503494	When the Horror Squad is done building it will remain in reserve within the building until it is Summoned or the Sacrificial Circle is destroyed.
503495	When you are ready to Summon the Horror Squad, click on the Summon Daemons icon on the Sacrificial Circle taskbar and then click on any visible area of the battlefield.
503496	Well Done! The Horrors have arrived. Horror Squads come in fixed sizes and cannot be reinforced. Their real gift is surprise.
503497	
503500	Build a Daemon Pit
503501	With the Stronghold upgraded to a Desecrated Fortress, we can now build a Daemon Pit. Select your Heretic and build a Daemon Pit.
503502	
503503	With the Stronghold upgraded to a Desecrated Fortress, we can now build a Daemon Pit, the source of the ultimate daemon power.
503504	The Daemon Pit grants access to Obliterators and the ability to summon the Greater Daemon of Khorne.
503505	At last! The Daemon Pit, source of ultimate evil.
503506	
503510	The Chaos race is similar to the Space Marines in that the core of the army is a tough and versatile warrior equally capable of shooting and assault, but the similarities end there.
503511	Chaos has a lot more assault-oriented options than the Space Marines, but has access to a much smaller selection of vehicles.
503512	Chaos also has the most methods of getting units straight from a building into combat; with summoned Horrors, deepstriking Obliterators and, of course, the possession of the Bloodthirster.
503513	
503520	Summon a Bloodthirster
503521	To summon the Bloodthirster, ultimate champion of the Dark Powers, you must first select the Daemon Pit and research the Bloodthirster. Once it is complete, the Summon Bloodthirster icon will appear on your Chaos Lord, Sorceror and any Aspiring Champions. To Summon the Bloodthirster, click the icon and watch the terror unfold.
503522	
503523	It is time to summon then ultimate champion of the Dark Powers, the Bloodthirster. Select the Daemon Pit and begin by researching the Bloodthirster.
503524	When the research is done, the Summon Bloodthirster icon will appear on the taskbar of your Chaos Lord, Sorceror and any Aspiring Champions.
503525	When you are ready to Summon the Bloodthirster, click on the Summon Bloodthirster icon and watch the possession take place.
503526	Quake in fear! The Bloodthirster has arrived! The Bloodthirster lives on battle. Keep him in the thick of combat or his health will ebb away.
503527
