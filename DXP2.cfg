719010	Tau

719012	Chaos Marines
719200	Absolute Zero (2)
719201	These two bitter-cold promontories are renowned for their strategic importance, and their harsh, freezing winds. Troops unfortunate enough to be assigned here have given several nicknames to the post, "Absolute Zero" being the least profane.
719202	Quest's Triumph (2)
719203	This is the sacred valley where Lord Jonathor Quest, "Biffy" Drecker's commanding officer, defeated the dreaded Warboss Kodos, despite being hopelessly outnumbered. Biffy was trying to imitate this unlikely victory when he met his untimely end at "Biffy's Peril." "You can't teach ingenuity," was Quest's response upon hearing the news.
719204	Abandon All Hope (2)
719205	The vegetation on the swamp world of Galmor is so thick, and the mud so treacherous, that drop zones are difficult, if not impossible to find. This often means that opposing armies are dropping troops right on top of each other while trading salvoes in orbit.
719206	Shrine of Excellion (2)
719207	This shrine is dedicated to the Warp Spider Exarch known as “Excellion.” Excellion’s brilliant tactics managed to save the Craftworld “Invincible” from certain destruction by the Dark Eldar. The shrine was erected by the Farseer Anaya in memory of the fallen warrior’s deeds. Some believe that the shrine itself has the ability to cure the faithful. Such heresies, of course, are not to be believed.
719208	Eden (2)
719209	The strange properties of this world's ecosystem allow it to quickly recover from the many battles that have been fought here. Eden's gently flowing creeks and pristine meadows belie the death and carnage that often occur on this hotly disputed world.
719210	Ice Flow (4)
719211	What race would be mad enough to fight on the cracking flows of a disintegrating glacier? Several races, apparently, seeing as how this crumbling glacier moon has been the site of countless epic battles.
719212	Gor'Hael Crater (4)
719213	This crater was once the meeting place of Circle Noir, a mysterious cabal of Chaos Lords who ravaged large parts of the Segmentum Tempestus before being driven back into the warp. The simple-minded inhabitants of this world often claim that their former masters will one day return. "Let them come," say the Ultramarines, "We will crush them yet again."
719214	Into the Breach (4)
719215	Due to poor planning, the Imperial Guard has been forced to retake this treacherous mountain pass on several occasions. The casualties have always been high, and the Imperial Commissars have had to scream "Into the breach! Into the breach once more, you dogs!" more times than a person could readily count.
719216	Dread Peak (4)
719217	The precise angles of this "mountain" force all to conclude that it was constructed by something other than nature. Troops forced to fight on this monstrosity of a structure are always filled with superstitious dread, and panic at the thought of offending "the makers" of this aberration.
719218	Tiboraxx (4)
719219	Tiboraxx was the legendary tribal chieftain of a heretic race that made his last stand on this mountainside. Tiboraxx was eventually defeated by the steady and methodical tactics of a young lieutenant by the name of Dustyn Bronn. Inquisitors have allowed the mountain to keep the heretic's name as a lesson to all who would doubt the power of The Emperor.
719220	The Eye of Gorgon (5)
719221	Gorgon was a bloodthirsty and ambitious Chaos Lord who was said to have met his end in this valley. Legends say that his eye implant, a gift from Khorne himself, lies buried somewhere in the valley, leaving the vestiges of Gorgon's unholy taint over all.
719222	Totmacher's Prison (5)
719223	This plateau is said to be the ruins of a massive prison complex built by Totmacher the Mad. Totmacher was an Inquisitor who imprisoned the populations of entire planets for perceived slights. Though he held great power while he was alive, Totmacher was posthumously declared a heretic. Ironically, this declaration was pronounced by his successor, who came to be known as Dominic the Merciless.
719224	Alvarus (6)
719225	This volcanic moon was named for Space Marine Sergeant Caudius Alvarus.  Caudius turned the tide of several wars by attacking the rear of the victorious army from the obscurity of this moon, always managing to retreat before reprisal could occur.
719226	Fury Island (6)
719227	This lone island on the ocean world of Brun is the site of the earliest known battle involving the Blood Ravens. For this reason, the Blood Ravens consider the island to be sacred ground, and long for the opportunity to prove their valor once more on its soil.
719228	Crozius Arcanum (6)
719229	This battlefield is the site of the heroic last stand of Space Marine Chaplain Maritus.  With his weapon, his skill, and his faith in the Almighty Emperor, he alone was able to hold the front line allowing for the Techpriests to revive the Machine Spirits of the waiting Thunderhawks and lift the men to safety.
719230	Thargorum (6)
719231	The desert world of Thargorum has always been a crossroads of death in Segmentum Tempestus, due to its strategic location and mineral wealth.
719232	Forbidden Jungle (8)
719233	Inquisitors have declared the jungle world of Saganor to be off limits, but the exact reason for this declaration has never been fully explained. The occasional battle still has to be fought here, though, and Inquisitors are quick to execute those who stray too far from camp, or exhibit a "heretical curiosity."
719234	Oasis of Sharr (8)
719235	The Oasis of Sharr may once have been a welcome sight to weary desert travelers in the distant past. Now, however, it is a sight of constant bloodshed, since it is now considered a sacred site to both the Imperium and the Eldar.
719236	The Torrents (8)
719237	Many armies have invaded this nameless, sweltering jungle world, but none have remained for long. Though one army has conquered another here, no army has conquered the elements of this unforgiving world.
719238	Polar Cap (8)
719239	The polar caps of Mendona are a vital part of the communications network of the Ultima Segmentum, and have been a constant target of raids and invasions from the beginning. So intense is the fighting on this world, that no civilian population remains.
719240	Tazin’s Folly (2)
719241	A brash Space Marine Lieutenant by the name of Tazin Briggs suffered a crushing defeat on this plateau at the hands of Doran, a Chaos Lord of some notoriety. Imperial operations in the sector were set back several years as a result. So insolent was Briggs in defeat, that some suspect that even his skull continues to spout profanities from the top of the spike it mounts.
719242	Payne's Retribution (6)
719243	The few battles fought on this world have always brought visible swings in the battle for control of the Segmentum Tempestus.  One such battle was when the Imperial Captain Harleton "Harazzer" Payne avenged the annihilation of the 648th Cadian Regiment by defeating the Tau warlord Rennikus, and drove him from the sector.
719244	Lonn V (2)
719245	The charred world of Lonn V was reduced to ash long before the records of the Imperium begin. The strategic location of the world continues to make it a hotly disputed planet, despite the fact that it cannot support life and has no mineral value.
719246	Lonn V (2)
719247	The charred world of Lonn V was reduced to ash long before the records of the Imperium begin. The strategic location of the world continues to make it a hotly disputed planet, despite the fact that it cannot support life and has no mineral value.

1000690	Witness my power!
1000691	In the Emperor's name!
1000692	Are there none worthy of my skills!

1000813	Who summons me?
1000820	Tell your men to stay out of my way.
1000821	If that is your wish.
1000822	A simple task, perhaps....
1000823	Then leave me to my errands.
1000824	Hush, say no more, my lord.
1000830	They will die silently.
1000831	Death comes in shadows.
1000832	One strike is all I need.
1000833	They will never see me.
1000834	Prepare yourself...
1000840	The enemy knows my position!
1000841	I cannot engage this many foes.
1000842	Where is my support?
1000843	Requesting support!
1000850	I shouldn't have lost!
1000851	Why did no one help me?
1000860	I will do this alone!
1000861	Never turn your back on an enemy.
1000870	You cannot kill death!
1000871	One or a thousand, I will kill them all.
1000872	Don't you need Guardsmen here?
1000880	Blink and I'll vanish.
1000881	In position to strike.
1000882	One chance is all I need.
1000883	I can change the tide of battle.
1000890	Moving into position!
1000891	Here I go!
1000900	I hold the secrets of the Machine.
1000901	I hear the machine spirit's voice.

1000911	I am honored that you require my skills.
1000912	As you wish, so shall it be done.
1000913	I am on it.
1000920	Of course.
1000921	I'll take care of it, lord.
1000922	An easy matter for one of my skill.

1001001	These repairs may require some time.
1001002	Ah, a challenge worth of my skills.
1001003	Initiating construction.
1001010	I'll be there as quickly as I can.

1001261	Orks, and where there's one, there's a hundred of them.
1001270	Eldar, and they look ready for war!
1001271	Those are Eldar? I thought they'd be taller.
1001280	What the hell is that thing!
1001281	Daemon! They have a Daemon!
1001290	We've spotted some kind of monster.
1001291	Whatever it is, it's an abomination to the Emperor.

1002202	Don't let them get past us!
1002203	Hold the line!
1002204	Annoint them with their own blood.
1002210	We've done this one a hundred times.
1002211	Remember lads, just like we did on Ceprus Prime.
1002212	We'll be in and out like lightning.
1002220	The objective is ours!
1002221	How long till we're relieved?
1002222	I hope this thing was worth it!
1002223	It's ours, but best we remain on our toes.

1002330	No quarter!
1002331	Annoint them in their own blood!
1002332	Do what you do best, men!
1002333	Death to the Emperor's enemies!
1002334	They shall regret facing us.
1002340	Faster, driver, faster!
1002350	We've arrived, and none too soon!
1002360	We need help!
1002361	I don't care how many there are, fight!
1002370	Only a fool would stay!
1002371	Leave the wounded behind!
1002380	I demand satisfaction!
1002390	What a glorious day to die!
1002391	You don't die until I say!
1002392	Raze the planet if you must!
1002393	Stay on them!

1002400	Move faster, damn you!
1002401	You're moving too slowly!
1002500	Standing by.
1002501	Warming up the engine, my lord.
1002502	Where are those damn techpriests!
1002503	Awaiting instructions!
1002510	Following orders!

1002512	We'll be off as soon as the fuel arrives!
1002513	Orders received and understood!
1002520	Attack!
1002521	Fire!
1002522	I die for the Emperor!
1002523	Cut a swathe through them.
1002530	Sentinels ready to deploy!
1002540	Sounds easy enough.
1002541	I'll take it from here.
1002550	They won't know what hit 'em!
1002551	Quick and fast, just the way we like it.
1002560	Moving to engage.
1002561	Hit them fast and hard!
1002570	Drive the enemy off!
1002571	This is one resource the enemy will no longer hold.
1002600	Ready to transport our men!
1002610	Acknowledged, sir.
1002611	Ready to act.
1002620	Moving into position.
1002621	It's an honor to serve the Emperor.

1002631	Fire, fire, open up with everything we got.
1002700	Hellhound here at your service.
1002710	I can take the heat!
1002711	We handle anything you throw at us.
1002720	We're hot and primed, sir.
1002721	Understood, but keep that artillery off our backs!
1002730	Burn them all!
1002731	Open the valves, full blaze!
1002740	Empty the tanks, burn them all!
1002741	On my mark, full inferno!
1002800	Tell the men, the cavalry's arrived!
1002810	Ready to win the war, sir!
1002811	Backbone of the Guard, ready to serve!
1002820	Understood... let's ride!
1002821	Nothing like a stroll through the countryside!
1002830	All guns, keep firing till they glow!
1002831	Run 'em over!
1002840	Time to rampage!
1002841	Let's bloody the treads!
1002900	Someone call for an earthshaker?
1002910	Fueled and ready to go!
1002911	Give us a second to get started.
1002920	Thank the Emperor... action!
1002921	This shall be the day of glory!
1002930	Firing solution plotted!
1002931	Plotting firing solution!
1002932	Fire!
1002933	3, 2, 1... Fire!
1002940	Main gun ready, FIRE!
1002941	Shatter their sky!
1003000	We will leave nothing standing!
1003001	Ready to unleash 11 barrels of Hell!
1003010	Whatever you want, we're ready.
1003011	We will make the Emperor proud.
1003012	We'll handle it.
1003013	Doubt is for the dying.
1003014	We will lead by example.
1003020	As you command, so shall it be!
1003021	You will not find us lacking, sir.
1003022	We'll flatten anything standing in our way.
1003023	We live by example and duty.
1003024	Failure is the weakness of the enemy.
1003030	All cannons at the ready! Fire!
1003031	All guns strike true!
1003032	Fire, all barrels hot!
1003033	Keep firing till they see the glow of our barrels.
1003034	Roll over them!
1003040	I think some fool just shot at us!
1003041	They might as well be spitting at our hide.
1003042	Incoming fire!
1003043	Permission to return fire!
1003050	All guns, on my mark.
1003051	All Guardsman, follow me to glory!
1003100	I am the Emperor's will made manifest!
1003110	By the Emperor, it shall be so!
1003111	I accept the challenge!
1003112	Faith is purest when it is unquestioning.
1003113	Your wise council belies your years.
1003120	May you lead us to victory.
1003121	I shall rally the troops to your cause.
1003122	Difficult, to be sure, but it shall be done.
1003123	Bless the mind too small for doubt.
1003130	To the last, kill them all!
1003131	Drive them back!
1003132	Redeem them with sword and fire!
1003133	Only in war are we truly faithful!
1003140	Spirit us to our objective, driver.
1003141	Our duty lies elsewhere so be quick.
1003150	Ah, to walk upon blood-stained ground....
1003151	So this is where the Emperor's will brings us.
1003160	Answer them shot for shot!
1003161	Their attacks are as weak as their faith!
1003162	So, the enemy has some shred of courage.
1003163	How dare they fire upon the Emperor's Chosen!
1003170	We have been humbled!
1003171	The battle is not ours, retreat!
1003172	Fall back, heed me and regroup
1003180	I hear the drums of war again!
1003181	Make your stand, here and now!
1003182	We will not falter another step!
1003190	We live and die as brothers!
1003191	Pain now, reward in the afterlife.
1003192	Mighty Emperor, guide my blow!
1003193	Spare none.
1003200	I will guide you now.
1003201	My brothers, we are together again!
1003202	None can match our combined might!
1003210	I am needed elsewhere!
1003211	Remember what I have taught you!
1003212	I must take my leave.
1003220	Rally to me, brothers, and we will win!
1003221	May the Emperor watch over us all!
1003222	None can withstand our faith!
1003230	For the glory of the Imperium, Charge!
1003231	Take them, and quickly!
1003232	Break the enemy line!
1003300	Kill! KILL!
1003301	For the slaughter!
1003310	Why aren't we killing yet!
1003311	By Khorne, it will be done!
1003312	This is the last time!
1003313	I am not your bootlick!
1003320	As you wish, but set us loose!
1003321	Don't provoke me!
1003322	This errand is beneath me!
1003323	I heard you the first time!
1003330	I will have last blood!
1003331	Split them open!
1003332	Blood for the Blood God!
1003333	I'll drink the blood from their hearts.
1003340	Drive quickly before I kill you.
1003341	Faster, if you know what's good for you.
1003350	We need a new driver... this one is dead.
1003360	The enemy, finally!
1003361	Let me kill them!
1003362	Must kill, must kill!
1003370	No, this cannot be!
1003371	They won, for now....
1003372	So much blood... too much to drink.
1003380	I hunger again.
1003381	I will have my vengeance.
1003390	Gut them, gut them all!
1003391	Engulf them in pain!

1014811	It is my turn to serve.
1014820	Disembark.
1015006	Shutting down all systems.
1015012	This will slow the enemy.
1015014	Stun charge away!
1015015	One shot, one kill.
1015030	The cadre will crush them.
1015031	All weapons online.

1015033	Target acquired.
1015070	Remember the lessons of Vior’la.
1015071	You can’t stand against the Tau’va.
1015072	The true test of a leader is in battle.
1015073	It's come to this, has it?
1015100	Carry on without me
1015120	Jetpack engaged.
1015130	Driver, we head for the front.
1015131	Boarding.
1015140	Multiple system alerts. I’m pulling out.
1015141	Fall back! Fall back!
1015142	Retreat! We’ll strike them again from another angle!
1015150	I will not be remembered as a coward.
1015151	In Tau, I am strong.
1015160	A sound tactical move.
1015161	I see what your plan is.

1015201	Great Tau! Warp beasts!
1015202	Aun'va preserve us!
1015210	Eldar raiders. What are they doing here?
1015211	The Eldar still resist the Greater Good.
1015212	So, the Eldar have chosen war over diplomacy.
1015220	Sensors picking up multiple targets.
1015221	Charge all weapons. The enemy is here.
1015222	The battle begins at last.
1015230	Imperium soldiers. Prepare to drive them out.
1015231	Invaders from Terra.
1015232	The Imperium of Man is here to enslave the Tau.
1015240	We’re going to need heavy weapons.
1015241	Signal a Shaper. Perhaps he can tell us what that is.
1015242	They're using wild beasts.
1015250	What are these mechanical beasts?
1015251	Necrons. The Greater Good cannot prosper so long as they are here.
1015252	Your genocide ends here, Necron.
1015260	Orks. Gun them down before they close to melee.
1015261	The Ork tide is here.
1015262	Greenskins.  We must free this land from them.
1015270	Space Marines! They will pay dearly for Damocles.
1015271	Gue'la fanatics. Get ready for war.
1015272	Imperium Space Marines. Prepare for a bitter fight
1015300	So they fight back, do they?
1015301	At least the enemy has some skill.
1015302	Remember the teachings of Vior'la.
1015303	Silence those gunners, now!
1015310	I am ready to lead.
1015311	I will spread the Greater Good.
1015320	Well done, driver.
1040010	More souls to feats upon!
1040011	I shall flense the skin form their bones.
1040012	I am destruction incarnate.
1040013	None can stand before me.
1040014	They are but gnats before me.
1040030	You dare order me?!
1040031	Do not think I serve you, fool.
1040032	On your knees when you beg of me!
1040040	All pale before my might.
1040041	I am a prince of the Warp here to purge this land.
1040042	I have ascended. None may challenge me.
1040050	You think to harm me?
1040051	Yes, fight. I will make your souls all the sweater.
1040060	Despair, for I am the end of days.
1040061	The age of the False Emperor is over at last.
1040100	You cannot hide from the eye of Chaos!
1050010	Feel my kiss and despair!
1050011	The great dance is at hand.
1050020	Like the ninety-nine blades of Vaul, I strike true.
1050021	Their dance comes to an end.
1050022	Isha will cry no tears for them.
1050023	My blade will taste their blood.
1050024	The Harlequin dances their end.
1050030	Possession is an illusion, but so be it.
1050031	Just as Asuryan claimed the Heavens, I shall take it.
1050032	You seek stability when there can only be change.
1050040	Come and relive the battles of yore.
1050041	None can escape the dance!
1050042	Let us play for them, Harlequins!
1050043	To war!
1050050	War with me as Khaine did with Vaul.
1050051	See your death in my eyes, mon-keigh.
1050052	This dance will be your last, so make it your finest.
1050053	In war, there is poetry; in death, release.
1050054	Long ago, Eldanesh and Ulthanash battled as we do.
1050060	Serve us as you did Vaul, Falcon.
1050061	Let no barrier stop you.
1050070	She Who Thirsts tugs at my soul!
1050071	I see Asuryan cast from his celestial throne!
1050072	Make for the webway!
1050073	The laughter ends!
1050080	Like Cegorach, I laugh at fear and pain.
1050081	I have my role to play and return to the stage.
1050082	As Eldanesh before Khaine, I shall not fear.
1050090	We are Kurnous's hounds sent to the hunt.
1050091	The troupe goes where the fates wish.
1050092	I go.
1050093	A new stage awaits.
1050094	The Laughing God calls and I answer.
1050100	The troupe is ready. The stage is set.
1050101	Long ago, Lileath foretold this day.
1050102	Let your enemies fear, for a Harlequin of the Laughing God dances at your side.
1050104	Death and Fate have taken the stage.
1050110	Your rune marks this spot.
1050111	This task is done and the dance awaits.
1050120	Their souls are dark but their weapons strike true.
1050121	They scourge us as Khaine did Isha.
1050122	So we dance a dance of battle again.
1050123	If you seek battle, you have found it.
1050130	I come to dance the dance of death.
1050131	The Laughing God's faithful have arrived.
1050140	From here, I continue alone.
1060010	Setting up.
1060020	Locking on… fire!
1060021	Open fire!
1060022	I've got them in the crosshairs, sir.
1060023	All guns, fire!
1060024	Drive them back!
1060030	Move! Move! Move!
1060031	Close with the enemy!
1060040	Open fire! Open fire!
1060041	That's it, just run into our guns…
1060042	Laying down fire.
1060043	Keep that ammo coming.
1060044	Don't let them get out of the field of fire!
1060050	We're being overrun!
1060051	The sandbags can't hold! Run!
1060052	Fall back! For the Emperor's sake, fall back!
1060053	No! I can't stop them!
1060060	They won't call me a coward!
1060061	Okay, we can take them.
1060070	Relocating.
1060071	Position confirmed, sir.
1060072	Heavy weapons on the move.
1060073	Moving to new firing position.
1060074	We'll get there as fast as we can.
1060080	Big guns ready to fire.
1060081	We'll cover our men.
1060082	Nothing will get through our field of fire.
1060083	Ready and willing, sir.
1060084	Where do you want us, sir?
1060090	Enemy gunners. Enemy gunners.
1060091	Come in, command! Taking fire at this position!
1060092	Get me a line on those gunners. Now!
1060093	Under fire.
1060100	You called for some suppressive fire?

1099008	The Emperor's Will seethes through my veins!  It will take more than a mere mortal to kill me!
1099009	I shall continue to fight.
1099010	Heavy Weapon Platoons will be needed here.  Requisition them.
1099011	This battle calls for Kasrkin!  They are now ready to be requisitioned.
1099012	We can now build Basilisks to reign hell upon our enemies.

1099024	Hellhound's are available to be requisitioned.  Bring them to the battle and let our enemies writhe in flame.
1099050	On the edge of known space rests the ice planet, Lorn V. Lost to the Imperium and conquered by Chaos, Lorn V will once more be a planet of war. A Titan, forged in the volcanic furnaces of Mars and capable of redirecting the course of war, lies lost in a frozen city. The Imperial Guard, led by General Sturnn, must recapture what was once theirs, while the mysterious Eldar prepare for the arrival of an unspeakable horror...
1099060	Lorn V, ice world on the edge of known space has been under Chaos control for what would seem an eternity. Whilst Orks wage incessant battles against the Chaos Lord Crull and his forces, all are unaware of the prize beneath their feet. Hidden in the heart of a ruined city, an Imperial Titan will drive the blood-crazed Chaos Lord toward his greatest conquest, while an Ork Warboss will join the battle and lead a planetwide WAAAGH!

1101070	Select your Field Command.
1101071	Left-click the Field Command to select it. Left-clicking on units and structures always selects them.
1101072	hint text
1101073	To select a unit or structure, simply click on it with the left mouse button. Go to your base and select the Field Command.
1101074	Congratulations! You have just learned how to select units and structures in the game.
1101083	Select your Field Command and look for the Guardsmen Squad icon located in the lower-right corner of the screen. Click this button now.
1101084	Take note of the small bar that is gradually filling up. This Progress Bar gives you an indication of how close something is to being ready.
1101085	Excellent! You now have a Guardsmen Squad.
1101093	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
1101094	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
1101095	Order the Guardsmen Squad to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
1101096	Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
1101097	Capturing and controlling the Strategic Points on the battlefield is how you increase your Requisition Resource.
1101098	Capturing a Strategic Point takes time. Do not move the capturing squad away from the Strategic Point until the progress bar is full. Otherwise, you will not take control of the Strategic Point.
1101099	Excellent! The point is ours! You must continue to capture Strategic Points to get more Requisition Resource, which allows you to build more units and structures.
1101103	Select your Field Command and build a Techpriest Enginseer.
1101104	Techpriest Enginseers are required to build additional structures. Enginseers are always available from the Field Command.
1101105	The Techpriest Enginseer has arrived! Enginseers are the Imperial Guard's builder unit. Any time you wish to build a new structure, you must use an Enginseer.
1101113	Select the Enginseer and build a Listening Post on the captured Strategic Point.
1101114	The Listening Post fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, increasing your Requisition rate at the same time.
1101115	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. You should continue to build Listening Posts on all your captured Strategic Points.
1101123	Some structures, vehicles, and research require Power to function. Building a Plasma Generator will supply you with the Power you need to keep your force going.
1101124	Select your Enginseer and build a Plasma Generator.
1101125	The more Plasma Generators you have, the faster you will build up the Power Resource.
1101126	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Field Command.
1101133	Select your Enginseer and build an Infantry Command.
1101134	The Infantry Command is the structure where you can build additional Guardsmen and more advanced Imperial Guard infantry units.
1101135	Excellent, the Infantry Command is finished.
1101143	Now we should focus on bringing our squads to full strength by reinforcing them.
1101144	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.  Select a Guardsmen Squad. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
1101145	Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
1101146	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a brother Guardsmen falls to the enemy.
1101147	You can click the Reinforce Squad button multiple times to bring the squad to full strength.
1101148	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Guardsmen Squad.
1101153	All units and vehicles have a Health rating. Health is represented by the small green bar underneath each squad or vehicle.
1101155	If you lose any units during a fight, you can Reinforce to bring your squad back to full strength.
1101156	Make sure you watch the strength of your squad in battle. Reinforce often, to make sure your squads are as effective as possible.
1101157	Remember that when a unit with a heavy weapon dies, you lose that weapon from the squad. You will need to upgrade the squad to get the heavy weapon back.
1101162	Now select a squad and take note of the small blue bar just under the squad's Health bar. This blue bar represents the Morale of your squad.
1101163	Morale represents the effectiveness of your units in battle. Think of it as a combination of mental focus, courage, and the willingness to fight.
1101164	Various weapons in the game inflict Morale damage as well as Health damage. When your squad takes Morale damage, the small blue bar will decrease, just like the Health bar does.
1101165	When a squad's Morale becomes too low, the squad will break. A broken squad has lost the will to fight, and its combat effectiveness is drastically reduced.
1101166	You do not lose control of broken squads. It is your choice whether to leave them in battle, or retreat to gather strength.
1101167	Morale can be an effective tool against your enemies. Also remember that certain units have abilities that can increase the Morale of a squad.
1101168	By destroying your enemy's Morale, you cause them to lose combat effectiveness, making them much easier to kill. In this way, a small but properly armed squad can destroy an enemy force of superior numbers.
1101169	Remember, tactics and strategy can turn the tide of almost any battle. Make sure you use this knowledge to achieve victory on the battlefield!
1101173	You will notice in combat that Guardsmen are much weaker than the warriors of other races, and quickly lose morale and flee.
1101174	This is because Guardsmen are ordinary men being asked to fight the most evil and monstrous threats in the Galaxy. They require strong leadership to overcome their fear and fight effectively.
1101175	Select the Field Command and build a Commissar. The Commissar will greatly enhance the strength and courage of your Guardsmen, and will help even the balance.
1101176	The Commissar has the power to execute soldiers for cowardice and disobedience. He inspires troops through fear and discipline, and by his own courage.
1101177	Excellent! The Commissar has arrived. But the Commissar will do you little good until he is attached to a squad.
1101183	Select your Commissar and click the Attach button. Now, select a Guardsmen Squad.
1101184	Notice how when the Commissar joins the squad, they rearrange themselves to make room for their esteemed leader.
1101185	A squad with a Commissar attached will never have their morale break. They will also take less damage from enemy units. Commissars are vital to your success as Imperial Guard.
1101186	You can also attach Priests to your squad when you advance in the Tech Tree. Priests also greatly increase the power of an infantry squad.
1101187	To detach the leader from this squad, simply select the squad, then click the Detach icon. It is located in the same place as the Attach icon. But remember that Commissars and Priests add little to your cause unless they are attached to a squad.
1101193	Notice the white ring that appears around some of your structures when you are deciding where to build. This is the Control Zone.
1101194	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Listening Posts, can be built at other locations.
1101195	When you are trying to place a new structure, its color changes from Red to Green as you move it around.
1101196	A Green color indicates that the structure can be placed at that location so that building will begin.
1101203	Most races have a single hero they can build that can lead their entire force. Imperial Guard are led by a group of several brave men commanded by the Imperial General. This group is known as the Command Squad.
1101204	Select the Infantry Command and build a Command Squad now.
1101205	The Command Squad is always lead by your General. The General can choose to fill out his Command Squad with other Imperial Guard leaders such as the Commissar, Priest or the Psyker.
1101206	Congratulations! You have finished building your Command Squad.
1101213	Select your Enginseer and build a Tactica Control now.
1101214	You must build a Tactica Control in order to access research and weapon upgrades. Squads can be equipped with a variety of weaponry, allowing you to prepare them against different enemy types.
1101215	Excellent, the Tactica Control is now operational.
1101223	Select your Guardsmen Squad and click the Upgrade: Grenade Launcher icon to upgrade a squad member.
1101224	Notice a Grenade Launcher appears in one of your squad members' hands. This procedure can be performed with any of the available weapon upgrades.
1101225	You can only upgrade a limited number of your total squad members with heavy weapons. But the power of these weapons makes the investment well worth it.
1101226	Excellent. You have upgraded your Guardsmen Squad. You can upgrade your squads anywhere on the battlefield to weapons that are well suited to counter your enemy.
1101233	Select a Guardsmen Squad and click the Add Leader: Sergeant icon.
1101234	Sergeants are brave soldiers that improve the combat ability and morale of the squad they are part of.  They also increase the health of every Guardsman in the squad.
1101235	Excellent! Your Sergeant has arrived. Note that your Sergeants are part of the squad and cannot leave it.
1101243	Select your Infantry Command and build another Guardsmen Squad.
1101244	You have built a Guardsmen Squad and fully reinforced it. You have also added a Sergeant and outfitted it with heavy weapons.
1101245	But the squad is still not at full strength. You need to build a Commissar from the HQ and attach it to the squad before it is fully ready for combat.
1101253	Select your Field Command and build a second Commissar.
1101254	You built a second Commissar. Now you must attach him to the new squad of Guardsmen.
1101263	Select your new Commissar and click the Attach button. Now, select the new Guardsmen Squad.
1101264	Excellent! You have built a second squad of guardsmen and have brought it to full strength.
1101265	Your field base has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
1101266	You can see your current Squad Cap in the Resource Area at the top of your screen.
1101267	Once you have reached your maximum Squad Cap, you will not be able to call in any additional squads, so it's very important to keep an eye on this as you're building up your forces.
1101268	You can increase your Squad Cap by building additional Infantry Commands. Each Infantry Command increases your maximum squad cap. But keep in mind that you cannot go beyond a squad cap of twenty.
1101269	To mount an effective attack, you should try to have several Guardsmen Squads, fully reinforced to maximum strength and Upgraded with heavy weapons, a Sergeant, and a Commissar or Priest.
1101273	Some types of terrain can provide your squads with protection from enemy fire. This is called Cover.
1101274	Select one of your infantry squads and move it into Cover. The area of Cover has been identified with a marker known as a Ping. It is visible on the Mini-Map as well as in the world.
1101275	Cover is useful in that it can provide your squads with additional defensive bonuses, which make them harder to kill.
1101276	It's easy to see Cover in the terrain -- just look for your mouse cursor to change as you pass over large bombed-out craters in cities, or patches of thick foliage in jungles.
1101277	You'll notice that when you move your squads into an area of Cover, a small Cover icon will appear above them. This indicates they are receiving a defensive bonus.
1101278	Excellent! Your squad is in Cover. Units in Cover are harder targets to shoot and take less damage from Ranged attacks because of this. Use Cover well to gain tactical advantages over your enemies.
1101283	The best way to make sure you have enough Requisition Resource is to capture and secure Strategic Points.
1101284	Explore the map around your base with your Guardsmen Squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must capture three Strategic Points.
1101285	Make sure to use your Enginseer to build Listening Posts on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
1101286	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Listening Posts on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
1101293	You can capture Critical Locations just like Strategic Points. In some multiplayer games, capturing and holding one or more of these Critical Locations can win you the game! You also get Requisition from any Critical Locations you control.
1101294	Use a squad to capture a Critical Location. Critical Locations are points on the map that represent locations of critical strategic importance.
1101295	Excellent! You've captured a Critical Location. Note that Critical Locations cannot have Listening Posts built on them. You must find other ways to hold them.
1101303	Holding Relics gives you access to your army's best units and vehicles. Hold on to them to ensure you have access to your best technology!
1101304	Use a squad to capture a Relic. Relics are sacred points of great value.
1101305	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Listening Posts to fortify captured Relics. You can also capture your opponent's Relics to deny them access to their best units and technology.
1101313	Select the Field Command and click the Battle Command Upgrade icon.
1101314	We must upgrade the Field Command to a Battle Command to gain access to powerful research options and powerful structures such as the Mechanized Command.
1101315	The Mechanized Command allows you to requisition vehicles. Vehicles are powerful units that can turn the tide of large battles.
1101316	The Battle Command is complete! You can now build a Mechanized Command.
1101323	Select your Enginseer and build a Mechanized Command.
1101324	Just like the Infantry Command is used to build infantry units, the Mechanized Command is used to build vehicles.
1101325	Vehicles are tough and nearly impervious to the attacks of non-upgraded infantry. They are a fundamental part of your army, and can carry powerful support weapons.
1101326	Excellent! You now have a Mechanized Command. You can build powerful vehicles from this building.
1101327	Note that your field base can only support a finite number of vehicles. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap.
1101328	Just like Squad Cap, once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can increase your vehicle cap by building additional Mechanized Commands.
1101333	Select the Mechanized Command and click the Sentinel Depot Upgrade icon.
1101334	The Sentinel Depot Addon will allow you to build Sentinels from this Mechanized Command.
1101335	If you want to build Sentinels from other Mechanized Commands, you will need to upgrade them with the Sentinel Depot Addon as well.
1101336	The Sentinel Depot is complete! You can now build a Sentinel.
1101343	Select your Mechanized Command and build a Sentinel.
1101344	Sentinels are quick raiding vehicles that excel at destroying other vehicles. They can also uncapture enemy points (though they cannot capture them).
1101345	Excellent! You now have a Sentinel.
1101353	Select the Mechanized Command and click the Basilisk Depot Upgrade icon.
1101354	The Basilisk Depot Addon will allow you to build Baslisks from this Mechanized Command.
1101355	If you want to build Basilisks from other Mechanized Commands, you will need to upgrade them with the Basilisk Depot Addon as well.
1101356	The Basilisk Depot is complete! You can now build a Basilisk.
1101363	Select your Mechanized Command and build a Basilisk.
1101364	Basilisks are heavy artillery vehicles that excel at killing infantry and buildings. Keep in mind that they can't take a lot of punishment, so keep them behind your army.
1101365	Excellent! You now have a Basilisk.
1101373	Select the Field Command and click the Regimental Command Upgrade icon.
1101374	We must upgrade the Field Command to a Regimental Command to gain access to powerful research options and powerful addons such as the Ogryn Quarters or the Leman Russ Depot.
1101375	The Leman Russ Depot allows you to requisition Leman Russ Tanks. Leman Russ Tanks are powerful all-purpose vehicles.
1101376	The Regimental Command is complete! You can now build more powerful units.
1101383	Select the Infantry Command and click the Ogryn Depot Upgrade icon.
1101384	The Orgyn Quarters add-on will allow you to build Ogryns from this Infantry Command.
1101385	If you want to build Ogryns from other Infantry Commands, you will need to upgrade them with the Ogryn Quarters add-on as well.
1101386	The Ogryn Quarters are complete! You can now build Ogryn squads.
1101393	Select your Infantry Command and build a squad of Ogryns.
1101394	Ogryns are heavy melee infantry that deal large amounts of damage and can take incredible amounts of punishment.
1101395	Excellent! You now have a squad of Ogryns.
1101403	Select the Mechanized Command and click the Leman Russ Depot Upgrade icon.
1101404	The Leman Russ Depot add-on will allow you to build Leman Russ Tanks from this Mechanized Command.
1101405	If you want to build Leman Russ Tanks from other Mechanized Commands, you will need to upgrade them with the Leman Russ Depot add-on as well.
1101406	The Leman Russ Depot is complete! You can now build a Leman Russ Tank.
1101413	Select your Mechanized Command and build a Leman Russ Tank.
1101414	Leman Russ Tanks are all purpose tanks that are good against infantry and other vehicles.
1101415	Excellent! You now have a Leman Russ Tank.
1101423	Select your Enginseer and build a Mars Pattern Command.
1101424	The Mars Pattern Command is a specialized building that only builds one type of unit: the Baneblade
1101425	Baneblades are legendary vehicles that are nearly invincible. They unleash unimaginable fire power and can destroy whole armies.
1101426	Note that the Mars Pattern Command, like the Mechanized Command, increases your vehicle cap.
1101427	Excellent! You now have a Mars Pattern Command. You can now build a Baneblade. Let your enemies tremble in fear.
1101433	Select your Mars Pattern Command and build a Baneblade.
1101434	Baneblades are fearsome vehicles that can destroy anything that dares to venture into range.
1101435	Excellent! You now have a Baneblade. Your enemy's fate is sealed. Send it forward to annihilate him.
1101440	To increase the number of squads you can field as Imperial Guard, you need to build additional Infantry Commands.
1101441	You've reached the maximum number of squads you're allowed to field. Be sure to Reinforce your squads to full strength to get the most out of them.
1101442	Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requisition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
1101443	Slag Deposits are concentrated points of energy hidden just under the planet's surface.
1101444	Take a quick look at your Mini-Map. There are dots on the map that represent Slag Deposits.
1101445	Build a Thermo-Plasma Generator on a Slag Deposit to access large amounts of the Power Resource.
1101446	In order to further establish your base you need an Enginseer.
1101447	Select your Field Command and build an Enginseer.
1101448	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points, and Enginseers to build Listening Posts on them.
1101449	Continue to build structures, and carry out research that will increase your effectiveness in battle.
1101450	Build additional squads and vehicles. Make sure you research upgrades that will increase both your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
1101451	Take this battlefield, and the next, and the next after that. The fight will never end until your enemies are crushed.
1101452	If you have invested unwisely, you can press the 'Delete' button on your keyboard to terminate unwanted squads.
1101460	The Space Marines' other commander units will become available as you build more facilities and unlock more research.
1101461	Select your Space Marine Squad and click the Upgrade: Flamer icon to upgrade a squad member.
1101462	Notice a Flamer appears in one of your squad member's hands. This procedure can be performed with any of the available weapon upgrades.
1101470	We must upgrade the Desecrated Stronghold to a Desecrated Fortress to gain access to more powerful units, research options and structures.
1101471	Excellent! The Desecrated Fortress is complete! Your power grows.
1101472	Notice a Heavy Bolter appears in one of your squad member's hands.
1101473	Excellent! You have outfitted your Chaos Marines with Heavy Bolters. They will now be much more effective against infantry.
1101474	You must build an Armoury in order to access heavy weapon upgrades.
1101480	The Dark Reapers are deadly marksmen that excel at killing units from a distance.
1101481	Excellent! You now have a Dark Reaper squad. Remember that Dark Reapers are ideal for making ranged attacks from a distance while Banshees tie up enemy squads in melee combat.
1101482	Warp Spider Squads have a more powerful ranged attack than the Dark Reaper, and their heavy armor allows them to take more punishment. They can also be upgraded to handle vehicles and destroy buildings.
1101483	Excellent! You now have a Warp Spider squad.
1101484	To reach the final tier of Eldar technology, we must first research Mobilize for War located on the Webway Assembly.
1101485	Excellent! The Mobilize for War research is complete. You now have access to the Eldar's most deadly units and technologies.
1101486	The time has come to build an Avatar. You can build an Avatar at the Aspect Portal.
1101490	Select your Shoota Boy Squad and click the Upgrade: Big Shoota icon to upgrade a squad member.
1101491	Notice a Big Shoota appears in one of your squad member's hands.
1101492	Excellent. You have upgraded your Shoota Boy Squad. You can upgrade your squads with heavy weapons anywhere on the battlefield.
1101493	Gretchin squads, or Grotz, can reinforce themselves for free, allowing them to survive longer on the battlefield. You should always reinforce your Gretchin squads to full strength.
1101494	Additional Grotz also decrease the time it takes to build structures, The time it takes to complete a building depends on how large your Gretchin Squad is.
1101503	Now is a good time to learn about unit garrisons and underground tunnels. The Imperial Guard can garrison infantry inside of some of their buildings.
1101504	Select your Guardsmen Squad and right click on the Field Command.
1101505	Very good! Your units are now protected from enemy fire. They can also use the building's mounted weapons against their enemies while inside.
1101513	The Imperial Guard dig tunnels between all of their buildings so they can move in safety. You can move your squads from building to building without ever leaving their protection.
1101514	Click on the Infantry Command. Notice that it has three empty slots. Notice how your squad in the Field Command is shown below. Click on the squad icon to transfer the unit from your Field Command to the Infantry Command.
1101515	Notice the timer bar over the squad icon. This is the amount of time it will take to travel between the two buildings.
1101516	Your squad is now in the Infantry Command. Click on the squad icon a second time to ungarrison your Guardsmen from the building.
1101517	Congratulations! You now understand the basics of placing your units in the protection of your buildings, and moving them from building to building.
1101523	Now that we have built a Command Squad we should reinforce it.
1101524	Add an additional leader to the Command Squad by clicking on one of the flashing icons now.
1101525	You will need your Command Squad to be at full strength if you want to counter the strength of the other races' heroes.
1101526	Congratulations! You have reinforced your Command Squad. You should continue to reinforce the Command Squad until it is at full strength. Remember that each leader type adds something to the squad. Diversity is strength in this case.

1101904	
1102075	To select a unit or structure, simply click on it with the left mouse button. Go to your base and select the Cadre Headquarters.
1102090	Select your Cadre Headquarters and look for the Stealthsuit Team icon located in the lower-right corner of the screen. Click this button now.
1102092	Excellent! You now have a Stealthsuit Team.
1102100	Stealthsuits use advanced technology to make them virtually invisible to enemy units. In Dawn of War, units of this type are said to be Infiltrated.
1102101	Infiltrated units can do everything standard units can without revealing their position, including firing on enemy units. This makes infiltrated units very powerful.
1102102	Be careful, though. Some enemy units are detectors, and any infiltrated units who get close to them are revealed. Revealed units can be targeted by any enemies.
1102112	Order the Stealthsuit to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
1102120	Select your Cadre Headquarters and build an Earth-Caste Builder.
1102121	Earth-Caste Builders are required to build additional structures. Builders are always available from the Cadre Headquarters.
1102122	The Earth-Caste Builder has arrived! Builder drones are the Tau Empire's builder unit. Any time you wish to build a new structure, you must use an Earth-Caste Builder drone.
1102130	Select the Earth-Caste Builder and click on the Build icon on the lower right area of the screen. This brings up the icons of all the structures the Builder can construct. Click on the Listening Post icon and then place it on the captured Strategic Point.
1102141	Select your Earth-Caste Builder and build a Plasma Generator.
1102143	You now have Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Cadre Headquarters.
1102160	Select your Earth-Caste Builder and build a Tau Barracks.
1102161	The Barracks is the structure where you can build basic and advanced infantry units from the Tau Empire's Fire caste.
1102162	Excellent, the Tau Barracks is finished.
1102170	Select your Tau Barracks and build a Fire Warrior Team.
1102171	Fire Warriors are the basic infantrymen of the Tau Empire. They have excellent range and damage with their pulse rifles, but are very weak in melee. To keep your Fire Warriors alive, you'll need to keep them at a distance from enemy units.
1102172	Excellent. You have built a Fire Warrior Team.
1102181	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness.  Select a Fire Warrior Team. Click the Reinforce Squad button to add one new unit to your squad.
1102183	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a Fire Warrior falls to the enemy.
1102185	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Fire Warrior Team.
1102210	To make up for the weakness of Fire Warriors at close quarters, the Tau Empire uses warriors from their allied race, the Kroot.
1102211	Select your Earth-Caste Builder and build a Kroot Barracks.
1102212	All Kroot units are build from the Kroot Barracks.
1102213	Excellent. You now have a Kroot Barracks and can build Kroot units.
1102220	Select your Tau Barracks and build a Kroot Carnivore squad.
1102221	Kroot Carnivores are primal warriors who have allied themselves with the Tau Empire. They are experts at melee combat and can tie up enemies so that Fire Warriors can gun them down.
1102222	Excellent. You have built a Kroot carnivore squad.
1102233	You can increase your Squad Cap by building research structures like the Path to Enlightenment and the Mont'ka Command Post. But keep in mind that you cannot go beyond a Squad Cap of twenty.
1102240	Most races have a single hero they can build that can lead their entire force. For the Tau Empire, this hero is the Tau Commander, a senior member of the Fire Caste who pilots a cutting-edge XV22 Battlesuit.
1102241	Select the Tau Barracks and build the Tau Commander now.
1102242	The Tau Commander's Battlesuit can be upgraded with a variety of weapon systems, including a flamer, fusion cannon and missile launchers.  The Tau Commander is the epitome of the Tau Empire's battle philosophy, moving quickly and packing a lot of ranged firepower. He is very vulnerable to melee attacks however, and has no melee of his own.
1102243	Congratulations! You have finished building the Tau Commander.
1102250	Select your Earth-Caste Builder and build the Path to Enlightenment now.
1102251	You must build the Path to Enlightenment in order to access research and weapon upgrades. Research increases your squads' effectiveness.
1102252	Excellent, the Path to Enlightenment is now operational.
1102260	Select a Fire Warrior Team and click the Add Leader: Shas'ui icon.
1102261	Shas'ui are veteran Fire Warriors who add more power to your squad.
1102262	Excellent! Your Shas'ui has arrived. Note that your Shas'ui is part of the squad and cannot leave it.
1102270	Fire Warrior Teams can also gain a second special unit called a Shield Drone. Shield Drones are small robots that can generate a powerful energy shield, protecting the squad from ranged fire.
1102271	Select a Fire Warrior Team and click the Add Leader: Shield Drone icon.
1102272	Like Shas'ui, Shield Drones are part of your squad and can't leave it.
1102273	Excellent. Your Shield Drone has arrived.
1102280	Select your Tau Commander and click the Upgrade: Flamer icon to upgrade his battlesuit with that weapon.
1102281	Notice the new weapon appears on the Commander. This procedure can be performed with any of his available weapon upgrades.
1102282	Excellent. You have upgraded your Tau Commander.
1102290	Fire Warrior Teams always have the same weapons, so they do not have weapon upgrades. You can use research to increase their combat effectiveness, however.
1102291	Select the Path to Enlightenment and click on the icon for the Advanced Pulse Rifles research. Like upgrades, research takes time. Research affects all relevant squads, however, instead of just a single one.
1102292	Excellent. All your Fire Warrior Teams now have advanced pulse rifles. They now do more damage and have greater range.
1102300	Unlike the Fire Warriors, Kroot Carnivore squads cannot be reinforced with special leader units like a Shas'ui or Shield Drone.
1102301	Kroot Carnivores can, however, be led by a special unit called a Kroot Shaper. Shapers boost the speed and health of Kroot squads, making them even more fearsome to your enemies.
1102302	Select the Kroot Barracks and build a Kroot Shaper.
1102303	Excellent! The Shaper has arrived. But the Shaper will do you little good until he is attached to a squad.
1102310	Select your Shaper and click the Attach button. Now, select a Kroot Carnivore Squad.
1102311	Excellent! The Shaper has now joined the Kroot Carnovore squad.
1102312	A Kroot squad with a Shaper attached moves more quickly and all members of the squad gain additional health.
1102313	Shaper can only attach to squads of Kroot Carnivores or Kroot Hounds, a squad available when you advance in the Tech Tree.
1102314	To detach the leader from this squad, simply select the squad, then click the Detach icon. It is located in the same place as the Attach icon. But remember that Shapers add little to your cause unless they are attached to a squad.
1102330	Time to put what you've learned to the test. Select a Fire Warrior Team and a Kroot Carnivore squad and move them to the indicated point. Remember to send your Kroot Carnivores ahead so they can screen the Fire Warriors from any enemy melee units.
1102331	Enemy spotted. Attack the enemy by right-clicking on the enemy squad.
1102332	Remember to bring your Kroot into melee and keep your Fire Warriors a short distance away. This way enemy units are pinned down. Reinforce your squads to make up for any casualties.
1102333	Excellent you have destroyed the enemy squad.
1102351	Explore the map around your base with your squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter along the way. To complete this objective you must Capture 3 Strategic Points.
1102352	Make sure to use your Earth-Caste Builder to build Listening Posts on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies.
1102371	Relics gain you additional Requisition, but aren't strictly necessary to build any Tau units. Most other races need Relics to build their most potent units, however, so by capturing Relics you deny your enemy access to their best units and technology.
1102372	Excellent! You have captured a Relic. You can build Listening Posts to fortify captured Relics.
1102400	Select your Earth-Caste Builder and build a Vehicle Beacon.
1102401	Just like the Tau Barracks and Kroot Barracks are used to build infantry units, the Vehicle Beacon is used to build vehicles.
1102403	Excellent! You now have a Vehicle Beacon. You can build powerful vehicles from this building.
1102405	Once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more vehicles. You can increase your Vehicle Cap by building research buildings, just like Squad Cap.
1102410	Select your Vehicle Beacon and build a Skyray Missile Gunship.
1102411	Skyrays are versatile support vehicles that fire missiles. They have excellent range and excel at disrupting infantry.
1102412	Excellent! You now have a Skyray. You can upgrade the Skyray by researching the Missile Barrage ability at the Path to Enlightenment.
1102420	Tau Empire cadres generally follow one of two broad strategies. Each strategy has its own research building called a Command Post and allows construction of special units.
1102421	The Mont'ka Command Post commits the cadre to the "Killing Blow" strategy that focuses on mobile firepower.
1102422	The Kauyon Command Post commits the cadre to the "Patient Hunter" strategy that relies of infantry and Kroot special units.
1102423	You cannot build both command posts during the same battle, so in each battle you will have to choose which strategy is best for the situation at hand.
1102430	For the purposes of this Tutorial, we will pursue the Mont'ka or "Killing Blow" strategy.
1102431	Select your Earth-Caste Builder and build the Mont'ka Command Post.
1102432	Excellent! You are now committed to the Mont'ka tech tree. Note that the Command Post has increased your Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap.
1102440	The Mont'ka Command Post has made new units available for your army. Select your Tau Barracks and build an XV8 Crisis Suit Team.
1102441	Crisis Suits are mechanized battlesuits with upgradeable weapons. Like all Tau battlesuits, they use Squad Cap rather than Vehicle Cap (used by heavier vehicles).
1102442	Excellent! You now have a squad of XV8 Crisis Suits. You can reinforce this squad and choose weapon upgrades for them as well.
1102450	The most powerful units of the Mont'ka philosophy are heavy vehicles like the Hammerhead Gunship. To build this vehicle, however, you need to pursue additional research.
1102451	Select the Mont'ka Command Post and research the Teachings of Mont'ka.
1102452	Excellent. You can now build the Hammerhead Gunship.
1102460	Select your Vehicle Beacon and build a Hammerhead Gunship.
1102461	Excellent. You now have a powerful Hammerhead Gunship on the field. This heavy tank can deal out huge amounts of punishment to the enemy.
1102470	Select your Earth-caste Builder and build a Coalition Center.
1102471	Excellent. Your Coalition Center is ready.
1102480	The Coalition Center allows you to build the ultimate Tau unit, the Ethereal. This hero is from the caste that leads the Tau Empire and has several powerful abilities.
1102481	Select your Coalition Center and build an Ethereal.
1102482	Excellent. The presence of the Ethereal strengthens all your Tau units, increasing their morale, health and the amount of damage they do.
1102483	The Ethereal himself also has several special abilities, such as calling down a strike from the orbital artillery of the Tau Air Caste.
1102484	Be careful, though. The death of an Ethereal can be a crushing blow to a Tau cadre. If your Ethereal dies in combat, all Tau units will suffer a temporary loss of morale and health.
1102490	To increase the number of squads you can field as the Tau Empire, you need to build research facilities like the Path to Enlightenment or the Mont'ka Command Post.
1102510	In order to further establish your base you need an Earth-Caste Builder.
1102511	Select your Cadre Headquarters and build an Earth-Caste Builder.
1102520	Use infantry units to capture Strategic Points, and Earth-Caste Builders to build Listening Posts on them.
1103075	To select a unit or structure, simply click on it with the left mouse button. Go to your base and select the Monolith.
1103090	Select your Monolith and look for the Builder Scarab icon located in the lower-right corner of the screen. Click this button now.
1103092	Excellent! You now have a Builder Scarab. Builder Scarabs are the Necron builder unit. Any time you wish to build a new structure, you must use a Builder Scarab drone.
1103100	Your main objective when playing the Necrons is to revive the Monolith, a mobile fortress that begins each game dormant and buried in the sands.
1103101	As you build secondary structures, you can revive your Monolith and gain access to more and more powerful units.
1103110	Almost all Necron units, structures and upgrades require Power to function. Building Plasma Generators will supply you with the Power you need to raise your deathless army.
1103111	Select your Builder Scarab and build four Plasma Generators.
1103113	You now have a steady flow of Power! Plasma Generators will continue to produce Power at a constant rate. Note that there is a limit to how many Plasma Generators can be built per Monolith.
1103121	Most structures can only be constructed within the Control Zone, while others, like Obelisks, can be built at other locations.
1103130	In addition to building structures, Builder Scarabs are also the only Necron unit that can capture Strategic Points. Strategic Points are located in areas of high strategic value on the battlefield.
1103131	Capturing Strategic Points denies them from the enemy. Other races use Strategic Points to generate resources, so capturing points can hamper their efforts.
1103132	Order the Builder Scarab to capture a Strategic Point by right-clicking on the Point.
1103134	Excellent! The point is ours!
1103140	Select the Builder Scarab and build an Obelisk on the captured Strategic Point.
1103141	The Obelisk fortifies your hold of a Strategic Point, which accelerates the speed at which you build units and structures and research upgrades.
1103142	Excellent! The point is now protected from enemy retaliation. Note that the Necron Time Modifier indicator on the top left of your screen has increased. You should continue to build Obelisks on all your captured Strategic Points.
1103160	Select your Monolith and build a Necron Warrior Squad.
1103161	Necron Warriors are your basic infantry unit. They wield powerful gauss weapons and are very cheap to produce, but are quite slow-moving.
1103162	Excellent. You have built a squad of Necron Warriors.
1103171	Reinforcing is the act of calling in additional troops to bring your squad to maximum combat effectiveness. Select a Necron Warrior Squad.
1103173	You can Reinforce during battle, in the event that a Necron Warrior falls to the enemy.
1103175	Congratulations! You have Reinforced your Necron Warrior Squad.
1103210	Your Monolith has supplies and logistics to support a finite number of squads. The number of squads you can support at any given time is called your Squad Cap.
1103213	You can increase your Squad Cap by capturing Strategic Points and building Obelisks on them. You cannot go beyond a Squad Cap of twenty in this way, but some abilities do allow you to do so.
1103220	Like most races, Necrons can build a single hero unit to lead their entire force. This leader is the Necron Lord, an ancient and powerful servant of the C'tan.
1103221	Select the Monolith and build the Necron Lord now.
1103222	The Necron Lord is one of your most powerful units and can receive a variety of upgrades and special abilities. You'll notice that the Necron Lord's inactive body is already in pieces near your Monolith.
1103223	Congratulations! You have finished building the Necron Lord. Note that the Necron Lord's existing body has reanimated rather than emerging from the Monolith. If the Necron Lord is later killed in battle, you can reanimate his body where it fell by building the unit again.
1103230	Reviving your Monolith and summoning forces can be a long process if your Time Modifier is low. To raise your modifier, capture and secure more Strategic Points.
1103231	Explore the map around your base with your squads and capture any Strategic Points you encounter using your Builder Scarabs. To complete this objective you must Capture 3 Strategic Points.
1103232	Make sure to also use your Builder Scarabs to build Obelisks on any captured Strategic Points. This fortifies them against your enemies and increases your Time Modifier.
1103233	You may wish to build more Builder Scarab squads from your Monolith and reinforce those squads to help capture and fortify these points.
1103234	Excellent! You have captured 3 Strategic Points and built Obelisks on them. Taking and holding Strategic Points is key to defeating your enemies.
1103240	Select a Builder Scarab squad and build a Summoning Core now.
1103241	You must build the Summoning Core in order to access more powerful units and to begin the revival of your Monolith.
1103242	Excellent, the Summoning Core is now operational. We are ready to begin awakening the Monolith.
1103250	Select the Monolith and click on the Awaken Monolith icon.
1103251	As the Monolith Awakens, it emerges from the sands and more of its ancient systems become operational. More powerful units become available.
1103252	Excellent! Your Monolith is now Awakened. Further upgrades will be necessary to make the Monolith completely operational.
1103260	Select the Awakened Monolith and build a Flayed Ones squad.
1103261	Flayed Ones are powerful melee units that are now available to add to our Necron army.
1103262	Excellent. Your squad of Flayed Ones is now ready.
1103270	You'll notice that the Flayed Ones haven't appeared on the battlefield yet. Indeed, these units can be called from their underground tombs anywhere your units can see, even in the midst of your enemies.
1103271	Select your Awakened Monolith. Notice the Flayed Ones icon in the display at the bottom center of your screen. This means a squad is ready to be deployed.
1103272	Left-click on the squad icon and then left-click anywhere on the map you have revealed.
1103273	In addition to doing serious damage in hand to hand combat, Flayed Ones project a terrifying aura, doing Morale damage to enemy units near them.
1103280	Select a squad of Builder Scarabs and build a Forbidden Archive.
1103281	The Forbidden Archive allows you to equip your Necron Lord with dread artifacts, making him even more powerful.
1103282	Excellent! The Forbidden Archive is ready.
1103290	Select the Forbidden Archive. You'll notice several different icons on the right side of your screen. Each of these artifacts are possible upgrades to the Necron Lord.
1103291	Some icons are grayed out, meaning that artifact isn't available yet.
1103292	Although there are many different artifacts available, you can never acquire more than three over the course of a single battle. So you need to choose your upgrades carefully.
1103293	For this tutorial we'll choose the Phylactery upgrade. Click on its icon now.
1103294	Excellent. The Necron Lord is now equipped with a Phylactery. A swarm of small scarabs surround him, making him harder to hit and confounding his opponents.
1103295	If you select the Necron Lord, you'll notice that the Phylactery icon has now appeared in the upgrades area.
1103310	Time to put what you've learned to the test. Select a Necron Warrior squad and a Flayed One squad and move them to the indicated point.
1103312	Note that the Flayed Ones take damage as approach, but the enemy squad quickly looses morale when they get near. Your Necron Warriors, meanwhile can fire from a distance.
1103320	Necron squads benefit from a powerful advantage in combat. As deathless constructs of the Star Gods, they are very difficult to completely destroy.
1103321	Whenever a Necron infantry unit is destroyed, there's a chance it will reassemble itself and rise again a few seconds later. Units that reactivate like this return at diminished health, but are otherwise fully functional.
1103322	This process is automatic, so you don't have to worry about it. Just don’t be surprised to see your troops pulling themselves back together to fight anew.
1103330	Select your Builder Scarab and build a Greater Summoning core.
1103331	Just like the Summoning Core, the Greater Summoning Core helps more of the Monolith's systems activate and allows you to build more powerful units.
1103332	Many of these new units are large skimmers that serve the function in a Necron army that tanks and other vehicles do in other race's forces.
1103333	Excellent! You now have a Greater Summoning Core.
1103340	Select your Monolith and build a Tomb Spyder.
1103341	Tomb Spyders are large skimmers with powerful melee attacks. They also have the ability to spawn additional Necron units. Like the Necron Lord, Tomb Spyders activate from their broken forms on the battlefield rather than emerging from the Monolith.
1103342	Excellent! You now have a Tomb Spyder.
1103343	Note that your Monolith can only support a finite number of heavy units like the Tomb Spyder. This limit is known as the Vehicle Cap.
1103344	Once you have reached your maximum, you cannot build any more heavy units. You can increase your Vehicle Cap by capturing strategic points and building additional Obelisks.
1103350	Tomb Spyders are able to collect the shattered parts of Necron infantry units and reassemble them. There are some Necron remains nearby. Send your Tomb Spyder there by selecting the unit and right clicking on the indicated point.
1103351	Now select the Tomb Spyder and click the Harvest icon. The Tomb Spyder begins processing the remains, removing them from the battlefield. Note how the bars on the grayed out squad icons on the bottom right of your display begin to fill.

1103410	Beyond the upgrades from the Forbidden Archive, the Necron Lord is also able to channel to essence of his mighty Star God, the Nightbringer.

1103414	This effect will only last a short time, but while it does, you may lay waste to your opponents.

1103600	Welcome to the single-player campaign of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade. These tutorial windows will guide you through the first two turns of play and introduce key features of this all-new campaign mode. / Your goal is to conquer the Planet Kronus. This world's inhabited continent is divided into twenty-five different provinces. Your conquest of the planet will happen one province at a time. / The campaign map is your major interface for directing your troops' strategic moves. Individual battles are fought on the smaller-scaled battle map.
1103601	This province is your stronghold, or home province. It is from here that you are launching your conquest of Kronus. If your stronghold is ever conquered, you will be pushed from Kronus and lose the campaign. / Since this is the first turn, this is the only province you currently control. / The enemy factions each have their own strongholds, identified by banners on the campaign map. To win the campaign and make Kronus yours, you must conquer all six of these heavily defended provinces.
1103602	The figure of your commander indicates the current position of your main army. You can only attack a province that borders the province where your army is, so its position on the map defines your options. / The enemy factions each have armies of their own and also can only attack adjacent provinces. One of your enemies, however, controls a space port in the Pavonis province. He can attack all over the map.
1103603	These arrows show you where your army can move or attack this turn. Red arrows indicate attacks into enemy provinces. Green arrows indicate moves into friendly provinces. / Since this is your first turn, and you only control your stronghold, you must attack an enemy province. / To move to or attack a province, left-click to select that province and then click on the Attack or Move button in the right panel. We should begin by attacking an enemy province. Select the province you want to attack and click the Attack button. / Left-clicking on a province always brings up these arrows (unless you have no more moves left this turn).
1103604	This screen shows you the forces you are leading into an attack and allows you to return to the campaign map if you decide you want to attack later. / Since this is your first attack, most options aren't yet available. / When you're ready to attack, just click on the Attack button. This will take you to the battle map, where you will face enemies in a game of Dawn of War.
1103605	As you conquer more and more provinces, you'll be awarded pieces of special equipment for your commander. This equipment is called wargear. / You will never be awarded a specific piece of wargear. Instead, for each award, you get to choose one piece from the list on this screen. (Note that you may have to get some pieces of wargear to unlock other, more powerful versions.)
1103606	Congratulations! You have conquered your first province. This victory has given you several rewards, including a piece of wargear and the bonus from the province. / Every province on the map has a special bonus. This bonus is displayed in the right-hand panel when you select the province. / Some provinces give you the ability to train a special unit for your commander's honor guard. Once trained, these units accompany your commander into the initial stages of battle. You can train these units (or retrain them if they are destroyed in battle) from the Commander Screen or the Attack Screen. / Other provinces give you special abilities, like the Eres Badlands which gives you the ability to attack twice per turn.
1103607	This is the province you've just conquered. Notice that it has changed to your color and that your army is now here. Whenever you conquer a province, your army moves to that province. / You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn, new provinces will be available for you to attack. / When you are ready to let the enemy factions act, click on the End Turn button.
1103608	The enemy repelled your attack on the province. / You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn you will be able to attack again and avenge yourself.  / When you are ready to let the enemy factions act, click on the End Turn button.
1103609	Each of the enemy factions will now act in turn. Like you, they each have their own strongholds and armies. They will each move their armies or attack and reinforce their provinces in turn. / Pay attention to where your enemies' armies are. Armies will reinforce nearby friendly provinces under attack, bolstering the defense with additional troops.
1103610	One of your provinces is under attack. / You can choose to fight on the battle map or to auto-resolve this battle. Auto-resolving can be dangerous, however, since it depends on the relative strength of your province and the attacker's forces. You always have a better chance of winning if you fight the battle yourself. There are also pieces of wargear that can only be earned by fighting defensive battles on the battle map, so you should think carefully before auto-resolving. / If you choose to fight and your army is on the province or one that neighbors it, your commander and his honor guard will join the defense. If not, you'll have to make do with whatever forces are garrisoned there.
1103611	It is now your turn to act again. / You'll notice that you have gained Planetary Requisition from the provinces you control. Each province produces Planetary Requisition every turn. / You use Planetary Requisition to reinforce your provinces by stationing troops there and to train honor guard units. / To reinforce a province, simply left-click on a province you own and then click on the Reinforce button in the right-hand panel.
1103612	This screen allows you to garrison troops in a province. These troops will be ready when you fight to defend this province from enemy attacks. / Stationing troops in a province costs you Planetary Requisition. The available units are on the panel. / Later, you can recall these troops (if the province is no longer at risk). Recalling a unit will give you back half the Planetary Requisition you spent to station it in the first place. / Be careful. All your purchases will be final once you accept the changes on this screen.
1103613	This screen provides you with a snapshot of your progress in conquering the Planet Kronus. It includes a running tally of your conquests, your commander's statistics, your honor guard and more. / If you haven't yet trained an honor guard unit (or you've lost one in battle), you can train it on this screen by simply clicking on its icon. / You can also access the Wargear Screen from here.
1103614	Congratulations. You have just conquered an enemy race's stronghold. This victory ends that race's attempt to take the planet. If you can conquer the five remaining enemy stronghold, you will win the game. / There may still be some provinces held by the defeated race, but without a stronghold they no longer have an army or the ability to attack. / You can mop up their remaining provinces to gain the associated bonuses, or you can move on to other targets.
1103615	You have conquered the Eres Badlands and gained the Fury special ability. / Fury gives you two full moves per turn, instead of just one. Just like before, you can use each one to move your army to a neighboring province you control or to attack a neighboring enemy province. / This ability is available right away so you can attack a second time this turn or move your army from the Eres Badlands before ending your turn.
1103616	You have conquered the Ariel Highlands and gained the Bulwark special ability. / Bulwark makes it cheaper for you to reinforce your provinces. This cost savings is applied automatically.
1103617	You have conquered the Hyperion Peaks and gained the Forward Base special ability. / When you attack a province, you will now be able to purchase structures from the Attack Screen. Each structure costs Planetary Requisition and appears immediately when you arrive on the battle map.
1103618	You have conquered Pavonis and gained the Space Port special ability. / The Space Port allows you to move your army around the campaign map much more freely. Instead of moving to or attacking only adjacent provinces, you can move to or attack almost any province on the map. / The Space Port does not allow you to attack a distant stronghold, however. To attack an enemy stronghold, you still have to do so from a neighboring province.
1103619	You have conquered the Vandean Coast and gained the Industrial Production special ability. / When you fight on the battle map, you will start with additional Requisition, allowing you to produce units and structures more quickly.
1103620	You have conquered the Vandean Coast and gained the Industrial Production special ability. / When you fight on the battle map, you will start with additional Power, allowing you to produce units and structures more quickly.
1103621	You have conquered the Aceria Forests and gained the Increased Manpower special ability. / When you fight on the battle map, you will start with an increased Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap, allowing you to field a larger force.

2503101	From “A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
2503102	In a foul shrine in the Deimos Peninsula, lost souls summoned the Black Apostle Eliphas to Kronus. There, the Word Bearers raised their black temples and launched their assault on the world. Eldritch energies split the earth with abyssal fissures, and remade the lush jungles into a nightmare landscape pulsing with ruinous energies.
2503103	A master demagogue, Eliphas made an advantage of the fractious nature of those bent to Chaos. Instead of relying on a unified defense, he allowed his champions and cult leaders to establish their own satellite temples where they could pursue their own dark rituals. Any attacker who hoped to defeat the Word Bearers would have to run a bloody gauntlet of heretics—including some of the Legion's most veteran Chaos Space Marines.
2503104	Indeed, killing the heretics on Kronus was pointless so long as the great Warp portal in Eliphas's bastion remained open. The dark spells of the sorcerers Amphion and Zethus maintained this massive rend in the fabric of creation, granting Eliphas endless reinforcements.
2503105	So long as the Deimos portal remained open, there could be no victory on Kronus.

2531003	My legion will burn your false idols to ash. Chaos cannot be denied.
2531004	You are intruders here. Your sacrifice will feed the gods of Chaos.
2531005	Our fates are all written in the Warp and yours is death.
2531006	The legions of Chaos are without end, intruder. You cannot prevail here.
2531007	Cling to your hope, my friend. It will make your destruction all the sweeter.
2531008	Only I can hear your prayers here, my friend. And I'm afraid I will not answer them.
2531009	Yes, drive back my warriors. I have many more. Many more.
2531010	In battle, we all honor Khorne.
2531011	Make peace with your gods for you die this day.
2531012	You cannot stop the Black Inheritance.
2531013	The Warp Gods will eat your dreams and drink your soul.

2531020	Well done. You've come further into this blessed land than I thought you would.
2531021	Lord Khorne will drink your blood from the very soil.
2531022	Your soldiers serve in their deaths. Send more of them to feed the power of Chaos!

2531031	You have a hunger for destruction. Join us and we can sate it together.
2531032	You weed the weak from my flock, friend. I will reward your service to the Dark Gods.
2531033	Ah, those who cannot defend their gifts do not deserve them. Come let me show you if I am worthy.
2531040	You cheat the Chaos gods of their due. You will pay for that.
2531050	You may have silenced the daemon for now, but I will feed him your soul soon enough.
2531100	I've waited a long time to speak with you, Taldeer.
2531101	Your whispers will not drive me from my destined course, Eliphas.
2531102	Oh, I certainly hope not. It is your destiny that has brought you to me.
2531110	Farseer. We have discovered a secondary warp gate. A mighty daemon circle.
2531111	Destroy it before they summon more of the Great Enemy's fiends.
2531112	LINE CUT PLEASE ADJUST SCRIPT.
2531120	Yes, come into my home, Taldeer.
2531121	I come to destroy you, monster.
2531122	Then why do I hear fear in your ancient voice?
2531130	Ah, welcome to Deimos, Governor Alexander.
2531131	Sweet Emperor! His foul voice is in my very head. Get me a Psyker immediately.
2531132	Your emasculated telepaths cannot protect you here, Governor.
2531140	Sir, recon squads report a concentration of heretics around some ancient ruins.
2531141	Clear them out if you can. But that Warp Gate is our primary target!
2531142	Yes sir.
2531150	This is it men! For the Emperor!
2531151	The False Emperor is not here to protect your men, Governor.

2531180	You come to your death, Necron. I will send you back to your tomb.

2531220	Welcome, Captain. Have you seen the truth at last?
2531221	I won't listen to your lies, heretic!
2531222	Then I won't lie to you, brother. You've been lied to enough….
2531230	Ancient ruins, Captain. There are traitors all over it.
2531231	Purge them. We must recover those relics.
2531240	Come, brothers. Let us welcome you home.
2531241	You stopped being our brothers when you betrayed the Emperor, filth!
2531242	Brotherhood is not lessened when one brother is foolish, Captain. You can still be forgiven.
2531250	Alien, you come here to your doom
2531251	I've got a buzzing in my comms. Switching channels.
2531260	Commander, we've located some sort of enemy temple.
2531261	It's a secondary base. If we wipe it out, our way to the main bastion should be clear.
2531270	Fire Warriors. Move forward. I want these Gue'la maniacs eliminated.
2531271	You come to your death, Tau.
2531272	And shut down that comm chatter!
2531280	A human sorcerer has several of your warriors trapped within chains of eldritch energy.
2531281	Eliminate that sorcerer. We must free the prisoners before they are lost to the Great Enemy.
2531290	Well done. Children of Biel-Tan, join us in the glory of war.
2531300	Their souls are with Slaanesh now, Farseer.
2531301	They shall be avenged, fiend.
2531310	Sir! Our men are trapped in unholy magics.
2531311	There must be a sorcerer nearby. Deploy a platoon and eliminate the heretic, sergeant.
2531320	Excellent. Deploy those men with the other platoons and prepare for the next assault.
2531330	Your men's screams feed the Warp Gods just as their blood feeds this land.
2531331	The Emperor watches over their souls, monster. And he demands vengeance!
2531340	Your mechanical forms are interesting, Necrons. Sooner or later, they too shall serve Chaos.
2531350	You may have freed some of your kin, Necron, but in the end you will fall!
2531360	Even the deathless may die, Necron!
2531370	Boss! Dem Chaos boyz 'ave got some of our boyz stuck with some weird stuff!
2531371	Bash dat sorcerer ta free the boyz, ya git!
2531380	Hah! Welcome back to da Waaagh! me boyz. Now get a choppin'!
2531390	More blood for the Blood God, alien.
2531400	Captain! The heretics have several battle brothers trapped by foul magics.
2531401	We will not leave our brothers to die. Eliminate that heretical sorcerer!
2531410	Welcome back, brothers. Join the purge and avenge yourself on your captors!
2531421	Their deaths shall be avenged in blood, Traitor!
2531430	Shas'o. The enemy holds several of the cadre's warriors trapped with unknown energies.
2531431	The Tau Empire does not abandon its warriors to such fates. Shas'ui, eliminate the gue'la controlling those energies.
2531440	Well done, shas'ui. See to it that the freed warriors join the ranks and prepare for an assault.
2531451	The loss of even the finest warriors shall not deter us. In Tau we are strong.
2540000	With the thirty-seven keys of Tzeentch, we open the way for our brothers.
2540001	With the thousand whispers of Slaanesh, we call to them.
2540002	With the twelve plagues of Nurgle we fell their enemies.
2540003	And with the mighty axe of Khorne, we cut open the world for them!
2540004	Yes, come forth to bear the Word of Chaos!
2540005	Hear my warnings, unbelievers, carried to your minds by the power of the Prince of Excess himself.
2540006	We have raised altars in this land so that we may sacrifice you to our gods.
2540007	Veterans of ten millennia of unholy war wait to grind you beneath the treads of their mighty boots.
2540008	The chosen of Khorne hunger to add you to their bloody tally.
2540009	The Blood God himself has marked this land and will claim your skulls for his throne.
2540010	There is no hope in opposing the inevitable.
2540011	Put down your arms, unbelievers, and bow before the forces of Chaos Undivided.
2540030	They reject the Word of Chaos, my lord. The faithful here are not strong enough…
2540031	It is a poor shepherd who blames his flock, Apostle. This failure is yours and yours alone!
2540032	No! I will not go to the Basilica of Torments again!
2540033	Fear not, Apostle. The Basilica is reserved for those who may redeem themselves.
2540034	No… no…
2540035	You will have no such chance.

2553102	Eldar rely on stealth and trickery where others trust in direct force and valor. An ancient and debased people, the aliens only sully their hands in battle when they have no choice.
2553103	When the Eldar's enemies at last tracked down their hidden base of operations in Tyrea, the Farseer Taldeer turned to a strategy of trickery. In this, she followed the ways of her ancient and deceitful race. Her forces were centered on a great reinforced hill in a remote, frozen area with very limited access. To cut off these access points, the Farseer lured cat's-paws to Tyrea. Orks dissatisfied with the Waaagh! of Warlord Gorgutz followed advice whispered by Taldeer's Warlocks and camped right where they could screen the Eldar from attackers.
2553104	The Eldar nevertheless built a substantial force of their own. Advanced Webway Gates allowed them to ferry troops from the wraithship hiding behind a holofield somewhere in the Kronus system. But these same gates were the Eldar's great weakness—if attackers could take and hold them, Taldeer would be cut off from reinforcements and any hope of escape.
2553105	Alone and outnumbered, the Eldar would be caught in their own trap.

2580041	The bastion remains strong, Farseer, but the webway gates to your wraithship are vulnerable.
2580042	Our course is clear, then. Protect the gates at all costs. Without them, we may never escape this world. We must drive the attackers back.

2580111	The fates have decreed that you must die.
2580112	For the Craftworld!
2580120	The enemy has taken a webway gate. Drive them back.
2580121	The wraithbone will never answer your call, outsider. Retreat now!
2580122	We cannot allow them to hold the gates for long. Show them no mercy, brothers and sisters!
2580130	Retake the gates or we shall never see the Craftworld again!
2581003	Captain.  We have discovered an Eldar forward encampment.  The Farseer herself is there.
2581004	In such an exposed location?  With any luck, we may be able to eliminate the alien in one stroke.
2581030	The Eldar witch is in league with Chaos. Strike quickly!
2581031	You are as deluded as that fool Eliphas, Captain Thule. I will kill you first and then scourge any Eldar I can find.
2581045	Captain. The main xeno encampment is at the top of the hill north of here.
2581046	Excellent. We will wipe them out.
2581047	The Eldar have prepared an escape, as is their cowardly nature. Three great webway gates stand near their base. But if we can capture them, we can trap them here once and for all.
2581050	Excellent news, Captain. By clearing the Chaos-held territory, we have linked up with an armored column from Fourth Company.
2581060	More of Fourth Company's armor was isolated in the mountains, beyond the Orks encampment.  They too have joined the fight.
2581070	Further reinforcements have arrived, Captain.
2582003	My lord. The aliens are camped to the west!
2582004	Yes, and their Farseer is with them. If we take her, the rest will fall.
2582030	Lord Eliphas of the Word Bearers Legion!  Your forces will march for me once you lay slain.
2582031	You truly think your tiny cult can overcome my Legion?  The thousand years of torment I suffered will seem gentle when you receive your sentence at my hands.
2582046	I grow sick of the alien's trickery.  We must trap them and finish them.
2582047	The auguries are clear, my lord. The Eldar have extended their webway to this world through three great gates at the crest of this mountain.
2582048	By dedicating the gates to the power of Chaos, we can trap the aliens here forever.
2582050	Ah, defectors from the renegade's forces. Serve me, and you may redeem yourselves before Chaos.
2582060	These Orks had cut off the armored scouts sent into the mountains. Now they may join us for the coming fight.
2582070	More of the Legion has arrived. They will join us in taking these gateways from the Eldar.
2583003	Boss!  Dem puny Eldar makin' a base west o' 'ere.  Da grots say one's wearin' dat big pointy hat you was talkin' about.
2583004	Pointy hat?  Dats da Eldar boss!  Get the boys together, we gonna go doff 'er up!
2583030	Dis day is lookin’ up! I gets ta kill me some Chaos boyz too!

2583050	You lot, you was supposed to flank dem Chaos boys. Yer late!  Bah, never mind, fall in with us, we gots more thumpin' ta do.
2583060	Don't shoot!  We gets it, Gorgutz is da strong one after all!  We follow da strong, we'll 'elp ya take dem Eldar!
2583070	More boyz just gettin' 'ere?  Well get movin', I need all o' ya stuck in against dem Eldar!
2584003	You have come for me, Necron, and I await.
2584004	Finally, you accept the inevitable.
2584030	Death will silence you, sorcerer.
2584031	Necrons! The Eldar has tricked us. Destroy these mechanical monstrosities and then find me that alien witch!
2584045	Craftworld Biel-Tan will never stop opposing you, Necron.
2584046	The analysis of your technologies is complete, Eldar. We know you cannot escape this world without your webway gates. We will take them from you and then purge this world of your race.
2584050	With the Warp sorcerer defeated more of us have risen from the caverns below, Eldar. Our purge grows stronger with every death.
2584060	We encircled your Ork pawns in the mountains, Eldar, and now our forces have regrouped.  It is time to end your tricks.
2584070	More of our dispersed servants have rejoined the battle.  Gather together, that we may silence the Eldar at last.
2585003	The Eldar Farseer has been spotted to the west. She is vulnerable.
2585004	Men. The witch Taldeer has taken a forward position. Strike quickly!
2585030	You’re just a pawn in that Eldar witch’s game, heretic. But we will dispatch you anyway.
2585031	You will die just like the False Emperor you serve!
2585045	The Techpriest's analysis is complete, Governor. The aliens are utilizing three great gates to travel to this world. By sealing those gates we can trap them here forever.
2585046	And mop them up from there. Excellent.
2585050	Fine work, men. Now that the western road is clear, we've linked up with an armored company and bolstered our numbers.
2585060	Second armored company reporting for duty, my lord. The Orks had us pinned in the mountains, but we're ready to serve again.
2585070	More reinforcements in from the borders?  Good, we need every last man to uproot these aliens.
2586003	Commander, we have located an Eldar mystic at a forward camp to the west.
2586004	Aun’el has spoken of these mystics’ wisdom. Surely she can be made to recognize the value in joining the Greater Good.
2586030	A masterful feint by the Eldar. We need to clean out these humans before we can proceed.
2586031	Alien scum! I will wipe this planet clean with you while that fool Eliphas only waits!
2586045	O’Kais. The Earth caste has determined that the El’dar are utilizing these structures to transport their invasion force.
2586046	We shall take them and trap their forces before they can escape. Then they will have no choice but to recognize the Greater Good.
2586050	With the western road cleared, Mission Group Theta made contact with the cadre.
2586060	We had thought Omega and Gamma Teams to be lost, but they live and are ready to fight for the Greater Good!
2586070	You who have just arrived on the field of battle, go to your Commander!  He has need of your help in confronting the Eldar mystics.
2586500	All is prepared.
2586501	Excellent. Exarch Rakanis, take your Warp Spiders to their positions and then return to the Aspect Shrine.
2586503	You have doubts, Harlequin.
2586504	I trust in your vision, Taldeer of Biel-Tan. But to stand surrounded by primitives makes me uneasy.
2586505	I understand your distaste. But Eldar rely on speed and stealth. We are not made for entrenched positions.
2586506	The Orks, however, make for excellent tools. They will keep the supply roads closed and our true enemies weak.
2586507	And if these attackers defeat the Orks?
2586508	I do not doubt they will overcome our cat's-paws, but it will cost them. And in their weakened state, they will face the Wailing Doom itself.
2586509	The Seer Council has named the Young King. Exarch Rakanis of the Warp Spider shrine shall sacrifice himself to awaken our most powerful warrior—
2586510	--the Avatar of Khaine.
2586520	Return to the main base. Let our enemies fight amongst themselves.
2586530	The Webway is closed to us now. We are trapped on this world.
2586531	The Avatar of Khaine has fallen.
2586532	Go, all of you. Find what refuge you can in the wilderness of this world.
2586533	Escape is still possible, Farseer—
2586534	I do not deserve that title, Harlequin. My vision has failed us all.
2586535	My fate is here and I shall not flee from it.

2603102	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
2603103	Upon arriving on Kronus, General Lukas Alexander became Governor-Militant and set about reclaiming the planet for the Imperium. When his enemies launched attacks on his capital, he prepared to repel them with extreme prejudice.
2603104	Experts in planetary defense, the men of the Imperial Guard were heavily dug in and fortified in Victory Bay. Any attacker would face well-armed and well-supplied soldiers backed by powerful armored columns and artillery positions.
2603105	The Guard’s only real weakness was its morale. Although most soldiers served honorably, the men of the regiment’s Fifth Company had proven less than stalwart and were placed under command of regimental Commissar Anton Gebbet in a forward base on the northern shore of the Victoria River. Without Gebbet's whip, the company and its base would surely fold.
2603106	Other companies took position in forward bases in more sensitive areas, ready to drive the enemy off. Still, determined attackers could overrun those positions.
2603107	Governor Alexander remained confidant, however. Indeed, any opponent who made it past his forward positions would find themselves staring down the barrel of the massive Hellstorm cannon of an Imperator Titan.

2653101	From “A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
2653102	The full extent of the Necron presence on Kronus did not become clear until those opposing them launched raids into the catacombs under the Thur'Abis Plateau. The first Necron massacres on the planet had occurred there and their enemies expected to find some sort of alien bastion. Instead they found an entryway into the underworld.
2653103	Garbled reports from doomed scouts sent into the cavernous passageways revealed a network of catacombs honeycombing the entire Plateau. Some of these now stood hollowed out, while others served as staging grounds for Necron forces. Worst of all, however, were the deeper tunnels where row upon row of Necrons still stood, slowly waking to join their lord's global genocide.
2653104	The attackers settled on a dangerous gambit. A strike force would enter the catacombs and plant a massive explosive device deep in the main cavern. An explosion there would collapse the entire network, crushing or sealing off the legions of still-dormant Necrons and shattering those already risen.
2653105	It remained to be seen if anyone could deliver this device, much less escape in time to continue the fight across Kronus.

2679000	Place Bomb
2679001	Place the bomb in the pool in the deepest part of the catacombs. Once placed, you will only have 8 minutes to escape before the bomb detonates, annihilating everything remaining within the stronghold.
2679002	The bomb won't do enough damage if placed here. It must be placed in the pool in the Necrons' inner sanctum.
2679003	The bomb is set. Escape from the catacombs before it detonates.
2679004	%1NUM% minutes until detonation!
2685000	We are deathless, interlopers. Under the shadow of the Beacon of Unlife, the fallen rise again.
2685010	All machines serve the C'tan in the end. Bring your vehicles before the Beacon of the Void Dragon and watch as they turn against you.
2685020	Time itself bends to the will of the C'tan, fools. Come before the Chronometron Beacon and be frozen into the stillness of death.
2685030	Darkness veils your eyes and dulls your senses. Before the Beacon of the Deceiver, we are like deadly shadows, hidden from your sight.
2685040	With every moment, more of us wake from the slumber of ages. We will never stop coming from the depths of this plateau until you are all dead.
2685050	Fools. You will never leave these catacombs. Our technologies are fully active again and your deaths are now certain.
2685051	LINE CUT PLEASE DELETE!
2686000	The Necrons are an offense to the Greater Good, Commander. We must destroy them here and now.
2686001	I concur, Aun'el, and I have a plan. The Earth caste has discovered that these catacombs are unstable. If we can place a fusion bomb at the deepest point, we can bring the whole complex down on top of the Necrons.
2686002	I see. The fate of this planet depends on your success, Commander.
2686003	I understand. I will plant the charge myself.
2686004	Very well. But this is no suicide mission, O'Kais. There are battles still to fight even if you succeed here.
2686005	I expect you to survive this day, Commander.
2686010	Sensors are picking up strange energies emitting from that structure. Their signature matches the energies used by the Necron Lord.
2686011	This beacon must be fearsome weapon. Destroy it before it reaches full power.
2686020	Another Necron beacon. Destroy it.
2686030	Necron monoliths. They seem to be dormant at the moment. Make sure they never awaken.
2686040	O'Kais to all teams. The charge has been set and the countdown has begun.
2686041	Secure an escape route and prepare to withdraw.
2686050	We've reached the surface. All forces withdraw now!
2686060	Commander, there are malignant energies concentrated at certain locations in this cavern.  Dangers certainly await at each one.
2686061	Better that we scout and eliminate them before planting the bomb. Any surprises while escaping could prove deadly.
2686070	Sensors indicate no activity from that tunnel opening. If we can find another access, we can move troops through them.
2686071	Another access to the abandoned tunnels. We can move troops through there.
2686100	Hear me, Word Bearers! This day we destroy the hateful forces of the Star Gods.
2686101	Warp-blessed Amphion and Zethus have prepared a great device, blessed by Lord Tzeentch's might. With it we shall bring down these caverns and crush the Necrons!
2686102	I will deliver this great artifact into the bowels of these caverns myself. Guard my advance and my withdrawal.
2686103	I will not give these machines the satisfaction of my death.
2686110	That black idol seethes with the Necrons' foul energies.
2686111	Destroy it, for the glory of Chaos!
2686120	Another of the Necrons' idols. Destroy it!
2686130	Monoliths! They seem dormant for now, but that surely won't last.
2686131	Destroy them all!
2686140	The artifact is in place. I return to the surface.
2686141	Protect my escape route at all costs!
2686150	I have escaped the catacombs. Prepare to witness the power of Chaos!
2686160	My Apostle, the power of the Star Gods runs through this place. It pools in these locations.
2686161	Word Bearers, send men to those areas. We cannot let the Necrons' machines go unchecked.
2686170	The Necrons have abandoned these passageways. If there is another entrance we can use these passages in safety.
2686171	Excellent. Another access point to the passageways. We can move troops freely through there.
2686200	Is the distort weapon ready?
2686201	Yes, Farseer. Carry this weapon into the bowels of these catacombs and you may eliminate these Necrons once and for all.
2686202	I see great strife between now and then, Harlequin, but I shall not fail.
2686203	But Taldeer, it is too dangerous. Were you to fall to the enemy, we could not continue.
2686204	Then I shall not fall, Harlequin. I will live to fight another day.
2686210	The loathsome energies of the C'tan flow through that structure. We must destroy it before it reaches full power.
2686220	Another C'tan beacon. Destroy it quickly.
2686230	We have found a group of dormant Necron Monoliths.
2686231	They must be destroyed before they rise to oppose us.
2686240	The distortion bomb is prepared! See Farseer Taldeer to the surface before it detonates.
2686250	Warriors of Biel-Tan! We have succeeded! The doom of the Necrons of Kronus is at hand!
2686260	Taldeer. I have seen terrible things hidden in these catacombs.
2686261	I have had the visions as well, Harlequin. I shall dispatch Rangers to scout those areas.
2686270	All the Necrons buried in these tunnels have already exited. If we can find another access, we may move through them as we do through the webway.
2686271	We have uncovered another access to the abandoned tunnel system.
2686300	The Techpriests report that the plasma bomb is prepared, Governor. They have identified the most auspicious place for it as well.
2686301	Excellent. Prepare your men. We are delivering this device personally.
2686302	To die in battle is the highest honor, Governor.
2686303	I have no intention to die here, sergeant. We still have a planet to free.
2686310	We've spotted some sort of beacon, sir.
2686311	The aliens are surely planning another trap. Destroy that thing.
2686320	Another beacon. Bring up some heavy weapons and take care of that thing.
2686330	By the Emperor, it's more of those Monoliths...
2686331	Get a demolitions team on those things, soldier. I want them smoking heaps before they can activate.
2686340	That's it. The bomb is set. Back to the surface men, on the double!
2686350	Soldiers of the Imperium! We have won the day!
2686360	Governor, the Techpriests have picked up alien energies coming from these points.
2686361	Send out some strike teams. We can't risk them cutting off our escape.
2686370	It looks like these tunnels are safe. We could use them just like our own base tunnels, if we can find another safe access point.
2686371	Another access to the cleared tunnels. Excellent.
2686400	I've gots yer bomb, Boss.
2686401	Gimme dat!
2686402	Okay, ya gits, lissen up. I'm gonna stuff dis here bomb down these Necron boyz throats. So lets get down there and get out right quick.
2686410	Hey Boss. Dere's some kinda statue thing here.
2686411	I hate all that black n' green stuff. Wreck it boyz!
2686420	Another one of those statues. Wreck that one too, boyz.
2686430	Boss! It's a bunch a those monolith things!
2686431	Those Necrons live in those things ya git. Wreck 'em!
2686440	Hah hah! Looks like it's gonna be a bad day fer them Necron boyz.
2686441	Let's get outta here!
2686450	Hah! Ya didn't think you could stop Gorgutz did ya, ya metal gits?
2686460	Boss, they got some right big generators or something running down there.
2686461	Where?
2686462	Here an' here an' here. Could be some good shiny bitz there.
2686463	Or some traps. Get some boyz to check 'em out.
2686470	Lookit. Them tunnels is empty of Necrons. If we find anudder way in, we can move some boyz through 'em.
2686471	Hah! Anudder safe tunnel entry.
2686500	Captain. The Techmarines report that the plasma bomb is ready.
2686501	Thank you, Brother. We must now deliver it into the belly of these alien catacombs and bring the sky crashing down upon these Necrons.
2686502	Though it may cost our lives, we will not fail the chapter.
2686503	We fail if we give our lives needlessly, brother. To die in the chapter's service is praiseworthy, but not if it leaves us without the means to fight the battles to come.
2686504	Your leadership is our most valuable resource, Captain. You above all must survive to continue the campaign..
2686505	And so I will, Brother.
2686510	The energies are coming from that alien artifact. It must be some form of weapon.
2686511	Destroy it before they can target our men.
2686520	Another Necron artifact. Destroy it!
2686530	Necron monoliths! Brothers, destroy these xeno abominations before they rise to attack us.
2686540	Brothers! The plasma bomb is planted. We make for the surface!
2686550	Blood Ravens! I have breached the surface. All remaining battle brothers withdraw!
2686560	Captain. Our sensors are picking up unknown enregy readings from these points.
2686561	We'll have to find out what's there. I don't want any surprises on the way out, sergeant.
2686570	These particular catacombs seem devoid of Necron defenders. If we can find a second access point, perhaps we can use them to our advantage.
2686571	Excellent. Another access to the emptied catacombs. We can move troops through here with ease.
2690006	Lucky creatures. At long last you have found the tranquility of death.
2690007	I was like you, once, clinging to life and blind to the truth.
2690008	When I uncovered the truth, I too shuddered and paled with fear.
2690009	Deep in these catacombs, I was remade. Here, my brethren slumbered for eons while the living grew like weeds.
2690010	My Lord knew this day would come. He had plans for us all. We would purge this world once more.
2690011	So come, poor victims of life. We will grant you tranquility in these crypts.
2690012	Kronus will be a Tomb World once more.
2690020	You have penetrated but the very surface of our catacombs.
2690021	More and more of us rise from the depths with every passing moment.
2690030	Bring them back, my Lord. The living are escaping…

2703101	To Split the Waaagh!
2703102	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
2703103	Those opposing Warlord Gorgutz Headhunter’s green tide faced the same challenge the Tau had faced on Kronus for generations: pushing the Orks back from the deserts and cities was one thing, but dislodging them from the jungle was another altogether. Even the legendary Tau leader Commander Farsight had failed to purge the Ork-infested swamps of the Green Coast.
2703104	Still, a complete purge wasn’t necessary to break Gorgutz. The Warlord had cobbled together his great horde (or "Waaagh!" in the parlance of the alien) from a large number of fractious clans and tribes. So long as the Warlord led the Waaagh! to victory, their clans’ loyalty was assured. But with enemies assailing them in their very homes, discontent reared its head among the Orks. Secondary chieftains wondered if they might not make better warlords than Gorgutz.
2703105	With these fissures in the Waaagh! widening, the Ork’s enemy’s struck. They drove deep into the Green Coast, hoping to eliminate Gorgutz himself and plunge the horde into infighting and rebellion.
2703106	For Warlord Gorgutz, the only solution was to crush the attackers under unrelenting waves of Ork warriors.

2742152	How bout dying? Do you do that any faster? I gots to plan da rest of me day…
2742153	Ah, I will miss this banter once you are dead, Ork.
2742200	You Eldar are startin’ to be a real pain, ya know that?
2742201	Our task here is too important to let one such as you derail it.
2742202	Hunh? Did you say somethin’, Eldar? I couldn’t hear for all that hot air youz blowin’.
2742203	Your infantilism is boundless, Ork.
2742204	And she still won’t shut it!

2742400	Death has arrived. We come for you.
2742401	Death? You look more like a humie who needs some feedin’, metal-boy.
2742403	We exterminated all life on this planet once before and we will do so again.
2742404	Dat was before my Waaagh! got ‘ere. Now, we’s the ones doin’ the sterminatin’.

2774604	You can only target locations your troops can see!
2774605	You are now in control of the Blood Ravens' Orbital Relay. You can now feed false coordinates to the Space Marines Battle Barge and call in orbital strikes!
2775000	We don’t fear you, heretic.
2775001	I should hope not, Captain. Fearless foes are much more satisfying.
2775002	The only satisfaction we’ll give you is a quick death.
2775003	And now you tire me, Captain. I’ve heard far too much empty boasting already.
2775004	Come on, then, if you think our boasts are empty.
2775005	Patience, Captain. I will kill you all in good time.
2775030	You won’t hold that for long, daemon-spawn!
2775031	Daemon-spawn? One so hopelessly ignorant of his origins should not be so quick to insult another’s parentage, brother.
2775032	We are not brothers, heretic.
2775033	Of course not. My mistake.
2775050	We fight to the last man, my brothers! This fortress shall not fall!
2775051	Such inspiring courage! Perhaps we’ll mount your corpse on a golden chair and make an idol out of you as well.
2775052	You pile heresy upon heresy, traitor. How could the Emperor have ever trusted trash like you?
2775053	Wonder instead how we ever could have trusted one such as him, brother.
2775100	Go back to the shadows, Eldar. You can’t win here.
2775101	I have already seen our victory, human. You simply delay the inevitable.
2775102	The Blood Ravens have never bowed before destiny or fate, and we won’t start now. The Emperor calls and we serve.
2775103	Seeing virtue in idiocy is the prerogative of the young.
2775130	Alien witch! You despoil our chapel with your presence.
2775131	Your Emperor is an illusion, human. I cannot blaspheme against something that isn’t divine.
2775132	You dare…!
2775133	Unless, of course, you pray to something else altogether from this ruined temple.
2775134	We will send you back to your Craftworld in a tomb!
2775135	I’ve known my death for ten of your lifetimes, captain. Don’t think to scare me with it.
2775150	The Blood Ravens will not be driven back by one such as you.
2775151	Take solace at least in facing defeat at the hands of your betters. There is no ignominy in that.
2775152	We have yet to meet our betters, alien, certainly not on this forsaken world. All we have seen here are deluded tyrants, heretics and alien scum.
2775153	You should have looked beyond your mirror, then.
2775200	This misguided purge of yours must end, Captain Thule. Segmentum Command has ordered this regiment to return Kronus to the Imperium. Withdraw your Space Marines before it is too late.
2775201	I have my orders as well, General. The Blood Ravens must purge this world for the sake of the chapter and the Imperium. We cannot withdraw.
2775202	Your loyalty to your chapter does you credit, Captain, but it will not stop me from carrying out my orders.
2775230	You tread in places for which you are unprepared, General.
2775231	I am quite comfortable in a chapel of the God Emperor, Captain. But perhaps you are not?
2775232	I serve the Emperor in all things.
2775233	Then withdraw, for His sake. There has been too much Imperial blood spilled already.
2775234	The Blood Ravens will not retreat, General.
2775235	So be it, then.
2775250	Surrender now, Captain. Your Space Marines are beaten. You only delay the inevitable.
2775251	It is not in my nature to disregard the orders of my superiors, General.
2775252	Then for pity's sake, obey me when I order you to stand down.
2775253	You have no authority over the Blood Ravens, General. We answer to our chapter and to our Emperor alone.
2775300	Your green tide stops here, Ork! You’ll find only death here.
2775301	I likes that kind ‘a talk, humie. I still gotz room on me stick fer yer ‘ead.
2775302	And I have room for you under my boot, alien.
2775303	Blood Ravens, attack!
2775304	Death to the alien!
2775305	Hah! Dis iz gonna be fun.
2775330	You defile all that you touch, Ork!
2775331	If’n you liked dis thing so much, humie, you shoulda kept it safe instead of leaving it out ‘ere. Now it belongs to da Orks!
2775350	I’m comin’ fer yer ‘ead, humie!
2775351	Come on, then! You’ll see what the best of the chapter has to offer your kind.
2775352	You sure do like to yammer, don’t ya humie?
2775353	We’ll fight to the last man!
2775354	O, shut yer maw an’ die, already!
2775400	Surrender, human. If not for you, then for the Greater Good.
2775401	The greater good is coming to you from my bolter, alien.
2775402	Do the deaths of your soldiers mean so little to you? Are you that mad?
2775403	Do the deaths of yours mean so much to you, alien? Are you that weak?
2775430	You will not squelch our faith so easily, alien.
2775431	The Tau Empire will respect your faith, human, if you would only see reason.
2775432	Our faith is in the Emperor of Man, alien. To bow to you is heresy.
2775433	Then you follow the path to destruction.
2775434	Better destruction than bondage.
2775435	So says the slave to the free man.
2775450	You should have surrendered, gue'la. Now it is too late.
2775451	Come on, then! Your death awaits!
2775500	Death has come for you, Space Marines.
2775501	We are the Emperor’s finest. We won’t fall to you, alien!
2775502	Your end is inevitable. Submit and spare yourselves the pain of living.
2775530	We will drive you from there, Necrons!
2775531	You will only follow your Emperor into death.
2775532	The Emperor protects us. We will not fall.
2775533	You will.
2775550	This fight isn’t over yet!
2775551	But your life is.
2776000	The enemy is at our doorstep and thinks he can push us off this world. He is already gloating. He can taste his victory.
2776001	But what he fails to see is that we will make this his last meal.
2776002	The Chief Librarian has ordered the purge of this world to protect our chapter's secrets. Are we to retreat with our duty unfulfilled?
2776003	Are we to let a black mark stain the banner of the Blood Ravens?
2776004	I say that we will not! I say our enemies will regret the day they ever decided to face us in battle!
2776005	Our Battle Barge orbits overhead and will rain the Emperor’s holy fury on our opponents.
2776006	More of our brothers will come to join the fight, but as ever our enemy outnumbers us. Each of you must be an army in your own right!
2776007	Veterans of the First Company, the finest of the entire chapter, stand with us. Let their valor guide your fire into the enemy's heart!
2776008	Remember that we are Blood Ravens, brothers. We have all sworn to protect fonts of hidden knowledge. Each one of us must fall before handing this world to the enemy.
2776009	The Emperor is with us. The Unknown Primarch is with us.
2776010	They have come for our blood but they will drown in their own!
2776011	North Vandea
2776100	Reinforcements have arrived. To battle, Blood Ravens!
2776200	No… We cannot fail…
2776201	The gene-seed must be preserved. Get Captain Thule to the Thunderhawk.
2776202	Understood.
2776203	Join them, Brother Apothecary, we will cover your escape.
2776204	And you?
2776205	We cannot allow the enemy to claim our relics. This area must be cleansed with orbital fire.
2776206	The Chapter will honor you, Brother.
2776207	There is no honor to be had in defeat. But, someone must deliver the targeting beacon.
2776208	Orbital control, lock onto this beacon and fire. Full power.
2777010	The Space Marines of the Blood Ravens chapter were well entrenched in their Castellum in North Vandea when they finally faced all-out attack. Utterly unwilling to surrender or retreat any further, the Blood Ravens prepared a mighty defense against the coming assault. Among those defending the keep were Space Marines drawn from the chapter’s hallowed First Company. These were the hardened veterans of many crusades, each man ready and able to face down whole squads of enemy attackers. The Blood Ravens on the ground would be further bolstered by fresh troops arriving from the Battle Barge Litany of Fury in orbit around the planet. Only two factors made the Blood Ravens at all assailable in their stronghold. Most critically, the fortress was unable to receive reinforcements directly from orbit. Captain Thule thus had to establish a forward base to receive drop pods and landing craft. Although well-defended, this base could be taken. Secondly, the Space Marines had established their base near ancient ruins which the Ravens claimed held relics of great importance to the chapter. Unwilling to desecrate the space by fortifying it, Thule opened the door to an enemy claiming the area and thus dealing a powerful blow to the normally unbreakable Space Marine morale. The battle of North Vandea would be one of the bloodiest of the entire war.

2803102	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
2803103	When the tide of war turned against the Tau, they faced attack in their stronghold in the city of Asharis (renamed Tash’n by the aliens). The aliens were well entrenched, however, and ready to mount a vigorous defense.
2803104	Shas’o Kais, the Tau military leader, made his headquarters in a mighty citadel in the city’s center, forcing attackers to wend their way through the tight city streets, exposed to sniper fire and ambushes. Outlying bases in different quarters of the city supported his strategy, with Kroot warriors and powerful armored units harassing attackers even further.
2803105	The Tau's only strategic vulnerability was Unity Plaza, the city’s main public space. A sophisticated communications tower there could potentially be used by an attacker to expose the stealth units positioned across the city.
2803106	O'Kais knew, however, that his attackers’ ultimate objective would be assassination, not conquest. Aun’el Shi’ores, a member of the mysterious Ethereal caste, led the Tau forces from the citadel in Tash’n. Were he to die, Tau forces would crumble.
2803107	But as long as the Ethereal lived, the Tau would defend Tash’n against all comers.

2841002	The Earth Caste is completing construction of the Mont’ka command post. Our armored units are ready to deliver the killing blow.
2841003	And our Kroot allies?
2841004	Also ready, Aun’el. The Kauyon command post in the city’s Kroot Quarter is prepared and the Shapers have readied the finest of their warriors.
2841005	Stealth teams are taking position across the city, ready to strike where the enemy is weak.
2841006	Strike teams of Fire Warriors and Kroot packs will defend the streets and meet the enemy head on.
2841007	Excellent, commander. Patch me through to the troops please.
2841008	Soldiers of the Fire caste! Kroot and Vespid allies! Today, we stand as a bulwark against the selfish, the soulless and the mad!
2841009	Today, we must drive back our enemies from our city and from our world!
2841010	Today, more than ever before, we fight for the Greater Good! And we will triumph!
2841100	Command posts, report.
2841101	Mont’ka command post online, shas’o. Crisis Suits ready for combat.
2841102	The Kauyon post is safe in the Kroot quarter. We will defend it, commander.
2841103	Excellent. Send strike teams at the enemy, but protect your positions.
2841200	The Enemy has overwhelmed us. The Mont’ka command post has fallen.
2841201	Take heart, Fire Warriors. The Greater Good shall prevail.
2841250	They’re in the quarter! The Kauyon command post is gone!
2841251	Do not surrender to despair! We have many forces left yet.
2841260	[Trooper] Commander -- Patrols are reporting in that they have run into a large invading force and they believe our outer base has been destroyed.
2841261	[Ethereal] Dispatch troops to destroy the invaders and begin calibrating the laser for close range fire support.
2841270	[Trooper] Commander -- Our bases are reporting they are under attack by enemy forces and we have been unable to raise our outer base.
2841271	[Ethereal] Dispatch troops to assist them and begin calibrating the laser for close range fire support.
2841300	Strike team alpha, attack!
2841301	[Ethereal] Excellent.  Were you able to reduce the cooldown time between shots?
2841302	[Trooper] Yes but at a cost to weapon power so although it should have no issues destroying troops, it will be unable to puncture building armor.
2841303	[Ethereal] Acceptable results -- Fire at will and make sure the weapon doesn't fall into enemy hands.
2841400	Protect the communications array. Deploy additional forces to Unity Plaza.
2841401	Is that fear I hear, alien? I will take your precious tower from you, then.
2841402	blah
2841410	A communications array. Capture it and our hidden enemies will reveal themselves to us.
2841411	You won’t take Unity Plaza so easily, El’dar.
2841412	I long ago surrendered hope of anything being easy, Commander. Still, we shall prevail this day.
2841420	Emperor be praised! Capture that communications tower, men, so we can deal with these damnable snipers!
2841421	Strike teams, deploy to Unity Plaza. Defend that tower.
2841422	Cut through them, men! For the Emperor!
2841430	The Orks have reached Unity Plaza. Protect the main communications array!
2841431	Oy! Sounds like we should get hold o’ dat tower, boyz!
2841432	Waaagh!
2841440	The Necrons have made it to Unity Plaza, drive them back before they disrupt communications.

2850000	The Janus Savannah
2850001	The southern edge of the central desert bleeds into the forests and jungles of the tropical belt across the Janus Savannah. Scattered ruins and lonely mining settlements dot the region, a wild, lawless frontier that attracts the disenfranchised and hopeless.
2850002	Desert/Savannah
2850003	Rocky outcroppings and brushland cover the savannah, which bakes under the summer sun. Occasional winter rains create short-lived blooms of wild grasses, that quickly dry up and become fodder for the next brush fire.
2850004	From “I Was a Slave to Speed” published on Tash’n News Net
2850005	You feel them coming before anything. A deep rumble travels through the arid ground, sending sand rats scurrying, and resonating somewhere in your brain. Danger is coming. A few moments later, the sounds start – the distorted whine of makeshift aero-jets and over-taxed stabilizers like a keening of some predatory bird.
2850006	By this time, any savannah dweller with sense is running for cover, loading a weapon, or both.
2850007	Finally, the dust clouds rise above the hills and black specks appear on the horizon. A mirage, you think, some trick of the heat rising off the baked earth. But in mere moments, what had been smudges in the distance are tons of steel hurtling toward you just shy of the speed of sound.
2850008	If you’re supremely lucky, you’ve just had the misfortune to find yourself in the path of a thousand-kilometer race. The Orks, ruffians, and twisted outlaws about to run you down won’t slow down at any cost, and if you can just get out of their way, they’ll be gone just as quickly as they came.
2850009	But maybe this isn’t a race between two madmen. Maybe this is a raid, in which case you had better have that weapon ready.
2850010	Like the Dark Eldar pirates from vid-stories, raiders descend on mining outposts and farmsteads in search of slaves, wealth and nasty fun. One gang uses nets pulled between speeders to scoop up their victims. Another drops makeshift firebombs in their wake, burning all they don’t take for themselves. And then there are the Orks, who ride in on their red-painted vehicles wielding fierce blades they use to decapitate the humans and Tau they run down.
2850011	Locals defend themselves as best they can. They retreat to bunkers outfitted with weapon-slits and try to drive off their tormentors. They build walls and lay razor wire. But the miners of the Janus Savannah are not teams of fire warriors and every attack claims a few more lives.

2850100	The Van de Mar Mountains
2850101	Broad and arid plateaus mark the Van de Mar range, which separates the central desert from the temperate Pavonian plains. Its highlands were the site of running battles between Imperial and Tau forces during the Lithesh Sector Crusade.
2850102	Mountains
2850103	The highest peaks of the Van de Mars are snow-covered all year round, while the arid climate of the central desert continues at lower altitudes. The highland plateaus are semi-arid patches of rock and scrubland.

2850110	+++ Text begins +++
2850111	My Lord Commander –
2850112	Battle continues against the Xenos known as Tau who have undermined Imperial authority in the Lithesh Sector. As part of the crusade force, elements of the 4th Company have come to the mining world of Kronus along with two companies of the 167th Brimlock Dragoons of the Imperial Guard.
2850113	The planet is very clearly in the hands of the Tau and much of the local human population seems to be either subjugated or to have betrayed the Emperor by swearing allegiance to alien powers. As previous reports have indicated, the Tau military forces rely on deviant technologies that can grant them impressive striking power in the field, especially at range.
2850114	Tau use of armored walkers akin (in size at least) to our holy Dreadnaughts has been especially effective. These “crisis suits” are equipped with a variety of heavy weaponry (again all focused on ranged combat) and powerful thrust packs that allow them to jump from area to area. This latter ability has been the subject of many curses from the Guardsmen fighting alongside us as we push along the plateaus of the Van de Mar Mountains. More than once we have fought long battles to reach the perch from which Tau heavy weapons fire rained down upon us, only to watch the very battle suits we had hoped to destroy leap to another, yet more inaccessible peak.
2850115	In response, we have pulled our basic infantry back and used a combination of land speeders and Marines equipped with jump packs to take away the enemy’s advantage. At this point, I must underline the critical contributions made by Sergeant Mallas Bomont of the company’s 1st Assault Squad. Sergeant Bomont has ever been a stalwart fighter, but he surpassed himself by leading three squads of Assault Marines against enemy positions. Armed with meltabombs and screened by a feint from the rest of our force, Bomont was able to cripple the two groups of battle suits that had pinned us down. Without the cover provided by these suits, the mixed enemy infantry fell before our renewed assault.
2850116	Despite their degenerate nature, I fear these Tau will soon adapt to our new tactics. I expect many more weeks of hard fighting before we are through these mountains.
2850117	I recommend that Sergeant Bomont be awarded the Novastar for his actions in the field and his tactical contributions.
2850118	
2850119	In the Emperor’s Name.

2850200	The Rhean Floodlands
2850201	Made of the tons of silt the River Rhea dumps into sea, the Floodlands are a tightly-packed series of small islands covered with dense foliage. The Floodlands support a diverse ecosystem, including a large Kroot population.
2850202	Jungle
2850203	An archetypal tropical climate pervades the Rhean Floodlands, featuring high temperatures, plentiful rains and pervasive vegetation. The silt islands of the region feature only mild topography.

2850300	The Aceria Forests
2850301	The Aceria Forests are home to several prominent universities and research facilities. Behind the idyllic walls of these institutions, intense – and some would say heretical – study of alien life takes place.
2850302	Forest
2850303	Temperate weather and plentiful rainfall feed the massive forest. Until the corruption of Deimos, the sea of trees was broken only by small rivers and a few small chains of mountains. Now horrors from the Immaterium haunt the south's twisted woods.

2850310	This is a planet of wonders and horrors both, Cumin.
2850311	My Servitors and I have arrived in the southeastern sections of Planet Kronus’s principal continent, continuing our search for the works of Magos Paladius, the most brilliant of the Tech Priests sent to Kronus to study the Hellstorm Cannon currently in Victory Bay. Following the thinnest of leads, we have at last uncovered a pure artifact of Paladius's time here immediately following the Horus Heresy, some ten millennia ago.
2850312	Amidst the trees of the forests on the southern edge of the arid heart of the continent, a Zeus-class relay and control station has seemingly stood undisturbed for thousands of years. It has taken me several weeks to find the proper rituals to awaken the machine spirits in the station so they would grant us access. The doors finally slid open two days ago and I have spent the time since pouring over the treasure trove that lurked within.
2850313	It seems that the relay station once controlled a network of orbital artillery stations able to rain destruction across the planet’s surface. Only a few of the satellites have survived, however. I imagine many were damaged or became hopelessly dormant over the millennia, but I have found traces of incomplete self-destruct orders in the ancient logic engine here.
2850314	More troubling still are the traces of actual combat within the station. The Ultramarines’ control of this station must have made a huge difference in their battle with the Word Bearers and I’m sure the heretics would have gone to great lengths to take the station from them.
2850315	I haven’t found any evidence of a breach of the station’s defenses, only traces of battle within. I cannot understand, then, how the heretics gained access. Or what happened to Magos Paladius.
2850316	I will report again soon.

2850400	The Thur'Abis Plateau
2850401	Thur'Abis Plateau Description
2850402	Desert
2850403	In the  heart of the great central desert lie the ancient ruins from which the Necrons have awoken. Indeed, below the sand and rock of the arid plateau of Thur'Abis lie the Catacombs of Kronus, their stronghold.
2850404	The Thur’Abis Plateau is an arid expanse of rock and sand, dotted with a few oases and the antediluvian ruins that hid the Necrons. Their catacombs are an underground warren of caves, ancient crypts and alien sepulchers.

2850409	Existentialism is possibly the most onerous imposition of life. The need to ask why, to find some explanation. Nevertheless, despite the perfections granted me, I remain a living man and so must suffer under the cacophony of questions in my brain. And so I send out this final message to attempt to answer some of the questions you will have.
2850410	Why did I lead my fellows to their doom here on this arid plateau? Why have I submitted myself to the power of the immortal creatures who have risen from its sands? How could I, a respected scientist and prominent citizen, turn my back on the civilization that has given me so much?
2850411	The answer is simple. I have done everything in the name of purity.
2850412	Before my memories and emotions were reassembled in this more perfect form some fifteen cycles ago, I had spent a human lifetime studying civilization in all its forms. The sum of my work can be put thus: all life exists in discord. War and strife affect all known societies and all species spend their existences competing with others for limited resources. From the cries of an infant for the maternal teat to the wretched stench of the aged dying in their own filth, life is a series of squabbles and ugly messes.
2850413	There is an alternative. There exists a state in which all conflict is resolved and all is cold and silent. There are no wants, no wars, no squabbles.
2850414	You may call this state death if you wish, but that is a misnomer. Death is but the ending of life, and that is only a means to an end. That end is purity, the time when all is still and unchanging.
2850415	Our universe began in purity and it will return to that blessed state. Hastening that return is the great work of the perfected beings I have awoken and who have made me their own.
2850416	You have tried to undo our great work. You have spread your vile, unclean selves across the galaxy, making a mockery of the beautiful silence we had wrought. It was all in vain.
2850417	Rejoice, for we have returned and your days are at an end.
2850418	
2850500	Tyrea
2850501	The largely uninhabited boreal forests and tundra of Tyrea now shelter the Eldar come to Kronus from Craftworld Biel-Tan. Before their arrival, only a few wild men and feral Orks called Tyrea home.
2850502	Sub-Arctic Forest
2850503	From the shores of the Northern Sea to the foothills of the Ariels, Tyrea is a harsh land. Ice fields give way only grudgingly to tundra and boreal forests and a cold wind seems to blow year round.
2850504	Fourth Meditation on the Mon-Keigh
2850505	By Taldeer the Dreamer of Biel-Tan
2850506	It is tempting to think of the future as a branching tree. From every decision point several possibilities branch out, each containing their own further decision points, and so on. Those who do not walk the Path of the Seer might well imagine that  we spend our lives following these separate strands.
2850507	In truth, the future is far more complex – and I fear to say, far less elegant – than that simple model. We Seers walk through a twisting labyrinth of possibilities and consequences, one whose tight passageways often fold back upon one another. As we explore this maze, we find ourselves treading the same ground over and over again, although perhaps arriving at it from different routes.
2850508	Among the passageways I have tread most is that made of the stubbornness and barbarity of the Mon-Keigh. No matter where I turn, I find its familiar stones under my feet. This young species may be simplistic and naïve, but they have an infuriating ability to impact the flow of events through their sheer mulish nature.
2850509	The time since the arrival of the Necrons on Lorn V has taught me this lesson again and again. These ancient destroyers of life are clearly a grave threat to all life, from the lowliest Mon-Keigh to the most ancient of our race. Any creature with a modicum of reason can see this and understand that other squabbles should be put aside.
2850510	Not the Mon-Keigh. In our warnings, they see deceit. In our guidance, they see entrapment. Even faced with the deepest truths, they choose to prove their barbarity by hunting us. Like all lesser beasts, they cannot be reasoned with, only yoked.
2850511	Let those who hunt us come, then. Let them bring their mulish ways to this next world where the ancients arise. Their deaths will serve where their lives have not.

2850600	The Vandean Coast
2850601	A mineral rich region, Vandea includes several large industrial centers built in the Imperial era and still in operation. The cities are now underpopulated and polluted, but remain critical industrial assets for the Tau.
2850602	Urban/Winter
2850603	The manufacturing and smelting plants of the Vandean cities have scarred the landscape and stained the air, making the cities valuable but hardly pleasant. Soot-laden snow or acidic rain fall from gray skies year round.

2850607	I regret to inform you that Vandea Minor Build Plants 27 and 29 will not meet their quotas this cycle. Production is expected to be at 72% and 21% of projections, respectively. Explanations follow.
2850608	Build Plant 27 suffered unexpected work stoppages and slowdowns due largely to the inclement weather that affected sector 27 of the city. A meteorological bottleneck of sorts occurs over the area, making it difficult for environmental agents to disperse and making the sector highly prone to acidic rains. This cycle's rains were the worst in twenty cycles, causing many health problems among the workers. Incentive programs and distribution of stims failed to make up for the decrease in productivity.
2850609	Build Plant 29 suffered a catastrophic detonation of its central power plant 4 sub-cycles ago, and has yet to come back online. Repairs have been ongoing since shortly after the detonation, but progress is very slow. I cannot even promise that the plant will be online again next cycle.
2850610	It seems evident that the detonation at Plant 29 was an intentional act of sabotage carried out by the most militant wing of the so-called Vandean Workers Pact, which as previous reports have detailed, claims that the workers in the cities are suffering needlessly. Clear explanation of the needs of the greater community has failed to convince this militant wing.
2850611	I repeat my request for dedicated Fire Warrior teams to pursue and eliminate these saboteurs. The local city militia is too limited and too prone to infiltration by pact elements to be up to the task.
2850612	Respectfully,

2850700	The Western Barrens
2850701	The Barrens are home to countless ranches and several mid-sized cities that have suffered for centuries under the attacks of feral Orks. The locals have fought long battles against tide after tide of aliens.
2850702	Desert/Savannah
2850703	The semi-arid Barrens are the traditional home to Kronus’s ranchers, moving huge herds across the dry brushlands. Small cities shelter slaughterhouses and transport hubs.

2850710	We lost Killian today. He’d been on the south tower for days, using his rifle to pick off the Orks as they scrambled up the wall. I thought he was doing okay, but he told me yesterday he was keeping count. He'd squeezed off hundreds of rounds, but only two of the greenskins ever went down. And they were smaller than most by a fair margin.
2850711	He started screaming when he saw the big green buggers climbing up the legs of the tower itself. They rammed a smoke-belching tractor into the razor wire and got up above it and the spikes. We fired on them too, but there were too many of them and they were too tough. Killian came at them with an ax when they reached the top of the tower, but it didn’t do any good.
2850712	They put his head on a pike on the tower.

2850801	The Tau capital of Kronus, Tash’n  is a modern and thriving metropolis with a full province of outlying communities along with several large military bases. Built on the site of the Imperial-era city of Asharis, it still bears many signs of Imperial architecture.
2850802	Urban
2850803	Protected by the Ariel Highlands to the north and warmed by the western sea, Greater Tash'n enjoys long summers and mild winters. Outside the dense sprawl of Tash'n itself, smaller cities nest along several navigable rivers.

2850810	I can’t believe you decided to stay behind. Danger be damned, this was the chance of a lifetime.
2850811	Okay, I’ll admit I had some doubts myself. The journey west to the capital was hard and we even saw the flashes of orbital battle lighting up the night sky over Pavonis when we passed through there. (Did you see any of that in Vandea?) But as soon as I got into the center of town here in Tash'n, all my doubts vanished.
2850812	There were large vid screens all over town broadcasting updates about the approach of the fleet from the first sphere Septs. When it looked like the humans had our ships blockaded, I swear no one in the whole city could speak. When we broke through, the cheers were deafening.
2850813	It was another day before we saw the ships landing at the space port. Like everyone else, I just took that as my cue to gather and wait. We pressed into Unity Square, thousands upon thousands of us and waited. All four castes were there as equals, Ukos.
2850814	Finally, a convoy from the port made its way into the square. (Hammerheads and Devilfish flanked by Crisis Suits, all painted in the orange of T’au itself! It was incredible!) The lead vehicle stopped behind the stage from where I was, so I only saw  him when he stepped up from the steps that run under the Unity Day statue. I remember the light glinted off his honor blade and I felt like I could fly right then and there.
2850815	
2850816	Aun’el Shi’ores was standing before me. The first Ethereal on Kronus for almost two hundred cycles!
2850817	There weren’t any speakers or other devices in the square to carry his voice, but it didn’t matter. He just spoke and everyone was quiet and listened.
2850818	“They have come to take our worlds,” he said, “to undo our works and to enslave us all. This cannot come to pass. For the Greater Good, we will not allow it.”
2850819	Then we started cheering. I can’t believe you missed it.

2850923	Valiance has so far caused six separate incidents of public unrest, most seriously a riot in the Oresta Secundus Machine Works. During this riot, Valiance dragged an earth-caste worker onto a makeshift stage and murdered him in cold blood. This prompted the crowd of humans to rampage through the streets and toward habitation units of other earth-caste citizens, resulting in 153 cases of assault before local authorities restored order.
2850924	Valiance is undoubtedly armed and dangerous.

2851000	The Panrea Lowlands
2851001	Bordering on the centers of human and Tau settlement on Kronus, the cities and agrifarms of the Panrea Lowlands have seen much bloodshed between the two races. Imperial loyalists waged a long guerrilla campaign against Tau authorities here, and the scars remain quite fresh.
2851002	Farmland
2851003	Located on the northern fringes of the temperate belt, Panrea is home to small-scale farming, large boreal forests and countless lakes. Winters are long but livable, with warm summers making up for the long snow-covered months.

They see us as pets and slaves, when they are the alien filth. They laud the benefits of technology when it can only lead to heresy and madness.
2851008	Will your children remember you with shame, as a traitor who kissed the hem of a grayskin’s skirt? Or will they take pride that you stood firm and resisted the subjugation of your world and the perversion of your faith?

2851101	The breadbasket of Kronus in the Imperial era, the heartland features well developed farmlands separated by small forests. The Imperial-built cities of the region still bear the scars of the ironlung pandemic which struck in the 39th Millennium.
2851102	Farmland

2851108	++ Medicus Secundus Felix Somnia Reporting ++
2851109	Dire news regarding the spread of the unknown pathogen causing the so-called ironlung plague. Medicus Centers in the northern sectors and in cities further west must prepare for full quarantine. What’s more, they must bulwark themselves against the action of seditious and heretical elements that seem determined to see the disease spread far and wide.
2851110	We here at the Critical Care Center have been serving as the central coordinating authority since the first cases were confirmed in the city, some 19 days ago. Our facilities are equipped for absolute containment and the first several waves of patients were brought here for isolation. Subsequent cases have been isolated in secondary care centers and converted habblocks as the sheer number of patients has surpassed our capacities.
2851111	Nevertheless, as of three days ago, we felt fairly confident that the spread of the disease could be stopped before it hit the more densely populated northern sectors. We had not counted on heretics who wished to see us fail.
2851112	Last night, a commotion erupted in the isolation wing as several infected patients turned on the staff, claiming the nurses were killing rather then treating them. Soon thereafter a voice (that of an outside heretical agitator, I believe) came over the vox caster system used for general announcements. This agent provocateur spewed heretical foolishness about ironlung plague being a blessing from on high rather than an affliction, that those who contract the disease should be honored as the chosen of the so-called Great Unclean One, and so forth. This led to an outright riot among the patients, one that quickly overwhelmed my beleaguered staff.  Over three hundred infected (and infectious) patients escaped the facility and fled into the city streets, heading north toward the population centers.
2851113	Any hope of containing the outbreak to the southern sectors of the city has now vanished.
2851114	Current death toll in Otrus City is 11,672 with over 22,000 more infected. I expect these numbers to quadruple in the next few days as a direct result of these heretical actions.
2851115	I pray to the Emperor for mercy.

2851200	Pavonis
2851201	The second-largest city of Kronus, Pavonis still resembles an Imperial city, despite the planet’s Tau ties. It is dominated by the ancient spaceport built there millennia ago.
2851202	Urban
2851203	The city of Pavonis has changed very little since the early days of human settlement;  its broad avenues still glorify the Imperium that abandoned Kronus. The winters are not as harsh as in the northlands, but overcast skies and cold rain are endemic.

2851211	The Machine God has blessed us!
2851212	I arrived on Planet Kronus in the Lithesh Sector alongside the advance force sent by the Imperial Guard’s taskforce charged with hunting a particular miscreant of the Eldar race. This target – a so-called Farseer of the Biel-Tan Craftworld – is said to be operating in conjunction with the newly encountered Xenos threat tentatively categorized as the Necron. These latter have been reported on Kronus and so the Imperial Guard sent agents to investigate and seek out evidence of their target’s presence here as well.
2851213	My purpose here is not, however, to aid in some fruitless Xeno hunt. Rather I am here to find the works of one Magos Paladius, a Tech Priest mentioned in the great archives of Mars as among the most enlightened our order has ever seen. In the days after the Horus Heresy, the Fabricator General dispatched Paladius to this then-unihabited world to oversee study of the great Hellstorm Cannon recovered from the Imperator Titan Aquila Ignis after it fell to heretics. That cannon remains in the city of Ironworks Bay to this day, but my studies indicate that Paladius did much exploring of this world. My hope in coming to Kronus was that Magos Paladius may have left us some undiscovered treasures when he set about making this world his home.
2851214	Kronus has exceeded all my hopes, and in the city of Pavonis I have discovered a true wonder. Cumin, I have uncovered a functioning Aeolis-class Orbital Control Post. I need not remind you that this is a Standard Technology Construct long thought lost. We have only the vaguest description of it as the “more-efficient cousin of the Kyber Tracking Station.” What a gift for understatement our Dark Age predecessors had! This station can track all orbital activity and plot courses to evade even the most complete siege formations.
2851215	My servitors have begun a complete visual study of the post, which I will prepare for transmission to Mars as soon as practical. In the mean time I find myself working with logic engine here hoping to find clues of where else Paladius might have invoked the Machine God with such perfection.

2851303	Extremely dense jungle lines the snaking River Rhean, although past attempts to develop agriculture have left some clearings in the foliage. The shade of the canopy can lead to cool patches, but the climate is generally hot and wet, with frequent storms in the autumn and winter.

2851306	My Lord Librarian –
2851307	My scout team has completed an initial survey of Planet Kronus in the Lithesh Sector near the anomaly known as the Damocles Gulf. As per your instructions, my brothers and I endeavored to mask our presence from the local inhabitants and to the alien powers who control this world. We arrived in system aboard the trading vessel Estrella’s Light, operated by Rogue Trader Simon Varnius, who has been of use to the Blood Ravens on several occasions.
2851308	While Trader Varnius traveled by shuttle to the world’s alien-controlled capital, my brothers and I used our modified Arvus-class lander to make landfall in the dense jungles of the south. As per you instructions, we pursued evidence of previous action by our brother Blood Ravens on this world.
2851309	Although the documents you provided to us suggest that the battle between our brothers and the heretics they pursued occurred in the north, we chose to land in the Rhean Jungle basin when our lander’s scanners picked up a signal beacon using the sacred codes of the chapter.
2851310	Our search led us into the densest jungle, infested with feral Orks and other creatures. We chose not to engage the aliens, lest we sacrifice the stealth that was our greatest advantage. We tracked the signal beacon to an overgrown junk pile – one of the common artifacts of longtime Orkish infestation. In that pile we found a battered (but still intact) narthecium case bearing the sigil of our chapter and a brief recorded message I reproduce here:
2851311	++Find here the holy progenoid glands of Brother Terrias Null and Initiate Ezekiel Remus, fallen in battle against the ruinous powers. We continue our march toward the center of power of the heretics, but I leave here these precious organs. I fear we march to the slaughter and would have at least some of our gene-seed survive the coming storm. In the Emperor’s name, I beseech you to return this case to the Omnis Arcanum. In His Holy Name, I am Apothecary Francis of the 4th Company, Blood Ravens Chapter.++
2851312	We have no way of knowing where or when the Orks found this holy item, although we can thank their barbarity for disposing of it so casually. I judged the recovery of this lost gene-seed to take priority over further exploration and ordered our return to Trader Varnius’s vessel. I do find myself wondering at the coincidence of names, however. The records you provided us seem to be penned by one Brother Remus, while this record points to the death of an Initiate of the same name. Could there truly have been two men in the same team with the same name? And if not, then who assumed Remus’ name after his death?

2851407	Subject: Survey of Planet Kronus (Ultima Segmentum, Lithesh Sector) – Report #217: Agamar Desert
2851408	Author: Scribe Johannes Klein
2851409	Overview:
2851410	The great central desert that dominates the inland of Kronus reaches out to the coast along the southern edge of the Western Sea, a large body of water extending  from the city of Asharris (now called Tash'n by the Xenos occupying the planet). Although not as inhospitable as the depths further east, the Agamar is hardly the ideal climate for human inhabitation and so has become a home for aliens.
2851411	Urban Centers:
2851412	The entire coastal plain is home to twenty-three habitation clusters with populations above 200, only one of which can rightly be termed a city, namely the regional capital of Jandus. Located in the mountainous highlands away from the water-line, Jandus began as a small mining colony established in the era before Kronus fell from Imperial grace. In more recent times, the Tau overlords have apparently directed a major expansion. The city now houses some 50,000 inhabitants (of which we estimate only 2,000 human souls) and several large industrial plants.
2851413	Historical Highlights:
2851414	The Agamar Desert was the site of several decisive battles between the Tau and Ork invaders. The Ork chieftain Mahrblud, rumored to be a personal envoy of the Warchief of Alsanta, led a sustained assault on the region, razing many of the smaller industrial outposts. His warband, estimated at over 10,000 strong in Tau records, then set upon the city of Jandus. The city’s defenders – a much smaller force of Tau, Kroot and humans – had the advantages of superior arms and entrenched positions, but suffered severe losses and many recovered Tau reports indicate a feeling that the city was doomed.
2851415	The defenders averted disaster by directing all their energies at eliminating Mahrblud himself. Armored units cut through the screens of Ork foot soldiers, allowing several packs of Kroot warriors to engage the Warboss and his entourage directly. According to several reports, when the Kroot raised Mahrblud’s severed head on a large pike, the Ork army rapidly fell to infighting.
2851416	Mahrblud’s skull remains on display in Jandus’s public square.
2851417	Climatology:
2851418	
2851419	The coastal plain is more properly an extension of the great desert that dominates the center of the continent. Rainfall is minimal and local vegetation is principally hardy cacti and dry scrub grasses. Major climate events are limited to sandstorms. The west-facing slopes of the highlands that separate parts of the coast from the arid inland are home to some micro-climates including bands of temperate weather fed by rainfall caused by moist air driven up the slopes from the coast proper.
2851420	Xeno Influence:
2851421	Very high. Population in the region is sparse, but dominated by Tau xenotypes along with several of their servitor races, including the Vespid. There is some evidence of feral Ork population in the foothills near Jandus and the city is home to small pockets of human population.
2851500	The Ariel Highlands
2851501	The major chain of mountains along the western coast of Kronus's major continent, the Highlands feature the highest peaks on Kronus. Several Tau cities and military bases perched among the highlands before the outbreak of the current war.
2851502	Mountains
2851503	The Ariel Mountains shelter several large temperate valleys separated by high peaks passable only through tight passes. In the north, blizzards can cut off these pockets of habitation for months or even years at a time.
2851504	++ sub-orbital tracking report ++
2851505	++ kor run’al 2345 reporting ++
2851506	Indirect observation reveals the arrival in the Tyrean hills north of our position in the Ariel Highlands of a significant number of vehicles and troops of unknown alien construction. Standard direct tracking methods reveal only minor energy surges in several areas of the hills. Nevertheless, the team of Pathfinders assigned to this station have undertaken several reconnaissance sorties and found evidence of alien troops moving between several concealed points.
2851507	Relying on analyses received from coalition command based on encounters in the third sphere expansions, it is probable that these signs point to the action of short-range warp-jump devices of some sort and of holographic technologies consistent with the unaligned agents known as El’dar.
2851508	These hidden gateways would allow large numbers of troops to deploy with very little chance of being detected. It is likely then that these El’dar have landed a substantial number of forces in Tyrea.
2851509	Note that stations such as ours in the Ariel Highlands are currently all that stands between any such invader and the capital city. We are well equipped to repel any attempt to pass over the peaks with aerial assault vehicles or even most ground assaults, but the use of these gateways is much harder to counter. Deferring of course to the wisdom of Aun’el, I humbly request rapid reinforcement, so that we may secure all the passes and contain whatever threat lies in Tyrea.

2851600	The Demes Northlands
2851601	A landmass reaching far into Kronus' arctic region, the Northlands are largely covered by polar ice and permafrost. Only outcasts and renegades have ever voluntarily made their homes in this harsh land.
2851602	Arctic Tundra
2851603	Demes features scattered boreal forests, rolling hills dotted with ancient mines, tundra and large ice fields. Snowfall occurs year round, with harsh blizzards striking throughout the winter.

2851610	Cumin –
2851611	I continue my exploration of Planet Kronus under the auspices of Task Force Retribution (established by the Departmento Munitorium) but in search of more of the holy relics of the Omnissiah thought lost on this world. The greatest of these, of course, is the great Hellstorm cannon of the Imperator Titan Aquila Ignis, recovered after the loathsome treason of Princeps Rufus Aquila and his Moderati during the Horus Heresy.
2851612	The journals of Magos Paladius, which I recovered in Victory Bay, speak of grave concerns that Princeps Rufus’s treason may have permanently corrupted the cannon. Although Paladius was careful with what he put down in his journal, he implies that the heretic crew gave themselves to the Chaos powers of pestilence, and feared the cannon might well be tied to that foul power still.
2851613	In traveling across the frozen wastes of the Demes Northlands, I have uncovered evidence that adds credence and immediacy to Paladius’s worries. Indeed, I had been tracking references to the cannon in the culture of this planet and found references to several “cults of the gun” having taken root among those who chose to live their lives on the planetary frontier. One such cult had been reported still active mere decades ago in the frozen Demes Northlands.
2851614	After some searching, we found the remains of this cult in a small encampment on the eastern ice fields. Their chapel was a ramshackle building marked with symbols that, although crude, clearly echoed the Hellstorm cannon. A skull surrounded by six large discs marked the main door, like a child’s representation of the gun’s barrels and fronting. Inside, we uncovered something more akin to a hospice. Ten wretches lived there, each in a stage of a withering pestilence. Small devotional shrines lined the walls, each more troubling than the last. While the cult’s crude symbols were present there, so were offerings of rotting meat and sigils reminiscent of those borne by the plague legions faced on the edge of the Maelstrom.
2851615	We purged these unfortunates and their foul chapel. But I am concerned that General Alexander’s wish to reactivate the Hellstorm cannon could release a foul pestilence of some greater sort.
2851616	I hope you can provide some guidance.

2851700	The Eres Badlands
2851701	The harshest area of the central desert band, the Badlands’ rocky dry terrain has claimed many unwary travelers. Unholy relics and foul ruins dot the Badlands, supposedly remnants of the battles of the Horus Heresy.
2851702	Desert
2851703	A natural depression on the eastern edge of the central desert, the Badlands have no known source of water. Only the occasional dust devil interrupts the pounding of the sun on this barren deathtrap.
2851704	From “Desert of the Lost: Three Cycles in the Badlands ” by Regias Han (Pavonis Press, Limited Release)
2851705	Along with thirst and hunger, madness was always with me in the Badlands. Eres is not like any other desert I had ever been in – there was something about it that slowly wore away at my mind just like the wind did the rock. Mirages and voices in the wind were constant companions, showing me the darkest corners of myself. I saw again and again the people I had hurt and lied to, the daughter I had abandoned, the wife I had betrayed.
2851706	But there were other mirages, images of things so terrible and alien that they drove me further and further into the desert, if only to escape them. The worst of these was a thing I came to call the Rose Lady.
2851707	I never saw her clearly, of course, but she was both the most beautiful and the most horrific thing I had ever encountered. In the depths of the night, she would step from the shadows, her eyes like rich quartz and her flesh a pale pink never touched by the sun. The moonlight would hint at the curve of her breasts and the line of her thighs, and waves of arousal would rush through my sleep-addled mind.
2851708	And her voice. I would hear her sing in the wind or whisper in my ear and would swoon. To this day, when I try to remember her tones, I get caught in loops of regret and yearning. It was like hearing a color, something impossibly beautiful but inherently wrong.
2851709	All the Rose Lady’s visits were rapturous, but they were also horrifying. Eventually, as she sidled up to me in my dreams, she would smile and reveal her terrifying needle-like teeth, or the light would catch the writhing serpents in her hair.
2851710	I woke screaming every morning, but yearned for her return every night.

2851800	The Hyperion Peaks
2851801	The site of intense Imperial-era mining, the Hyperion mountain range bears the huge scars of massive excavation and strip-mining endeavors. Even millennia later, the gashes in the landscape are clear.
2851802	Mountains
2851803	The Hyperion Peaks jut up from the arid expanse of the central desert, forming a barrier with the deep jungles of the Green Coast to the south. Old mines and quarries dot the barren northern slopes, while several rivers flow from the southern foothills into the jungle.

2851811	Exploration of Planet Kronus continues to provide a rich bounty of discoveries. My servitors and I have continued to explore the areas of oldest development on the planet in our search for Standand Technology Constructs or STC-derivatives.
2851812	Over the last three standard months we have moved among the peaks on the southern edge of the planet’s desert belt. These peaks are rich sources of minerals and bear the marks of intense mining activity in the early years of Imperial exploitation of the planet (circa 300.M37). Several large Manifactoria remain in use, extracting ores and sending them on in semi-refined states to the cities to the north.
2851813	For those with the eyes to look, however, it is clear that some of these facilities predate the colonial founding by many millennia. Indeed, the resource extraction rates recorded in the logic engines of the mines exceed any I have seen before. These mines are clearly closer to the Standard Template than any other mines in the Segmentum.
2851814	I have begun deeper exploration of the records within the logic engine of the oldest facility. Using the information gleaned from my analysis of the Pavonis Space Port, I have found the evidence once again of Magos Paladius, who arrived on Kronus shortly after the Horus Heresy. Paladius seemingly ordered the construction of these great mines to aid in the construction of several secondary research facilities.
2851815	The exact nature of those facilities and what became of Paladius and his wondrous knowledge of the Standard Templates left by our Dark Age predecessors remains unclear.
2851816	Assuming the blessings of the Machine God are with me, I hope to have answers for these questions by the time of my next report.

2851900	The Murad Swamplands
2851901	A large island at the mouth of the Morriah Sea, Murad is a dense and muggy region full of wildlife and dotted with ancient ruins. A few human settlements stand on the northern coast.
2851902	Swamps
2851903	The currents of the Morriah and Eastern Seas make for idyllic weather on the northern coast, but as soon as one leaves the beach, the muggy swamps of the interior take over. Tropical storms are commonplace in the summer and autumn.

2851907	Not sure if anyone is receiving these reports, but we think we’ve discovered what the madmen who have been assaulting us are after. This place used to be a weather station before this whole world went mad. There’s actually a vid-record here of the Deimos shoreline on the horizon and how it went from some tropical beach resort to a … to a, I don’t know what it’ become… Some sort of hell, I guess.
2851908	Anyway, we’ve been using this place as a base of operations. The walls are solid and we can pretty easily control access. But last week we started coming under nightly assault from what I can only think of as frothing madmen. I think they were human once, but they’ve obviously lost all sense and seemed to be launching themselves at us for no reason. They’d come in small boats across the straights from Deimos, shouting mad oaths I’d rather not repeat. We held them off night after night, but it couldn’t last forever, and I asked some of the guys to look deeper in the jungle and see if they could find another station or somewhere we could fall back to.
2851909	What they found has got to be what the freaks are after. I just came back from seeing it myself and I’m not sure I want to describe it… a sort of statue I guess… it was covered in creeper vines until we cleared off about half of it… I’m not sure what it’s supposed to be, it’s like flames or something with people caught in them…
2851910	There are lines and lines of text carved into the rock too, but I couldn’t read it. I’m sure some of it would sound a lot like the madmen’s screams.
2851911	The faces in the flames, though… they looked familiar… like I knew they’d be there…

2852000	The Morriah Coast
2852001	According to the humans and Tau who make their homes on the Morriah Coast, the ruins of some ancient civilization lurk deep in the unexplored heart of the inland jungles. The rise of the Necrons has given these legends a new and terrible verisimilitude.
2852002	Forest
2852003	The coast of Morriah Bay to the south is home to broad sand beaches and a pleasant, hot climate. The inland forests, however, feature heavier precipitation and cooler temperatures.

2852007	O’Shovah –
2852008	Our operation to drive the jungle-dwelling Ork population out of the peninsula north of the Morriah Sea continues to make slow, but steady progress.
2852009	The Orks of this region are far less organized than those we faced in the capital city of Tash’n upon our arrival on this world two cycles ago. Without the central authority of one of their chieftains, they seem to revert to savage tribal warfare tactics, more focused on raiding whoever is at hand than on making any concerted efforts to take and hold territory. Our cadre has thus been able to outmaneuver the Orks by anticipating likely targets for their aggression and striking at their flanks. This allows us to compensate for the massive numerical advantage enjoyed by the enemy, who outnumber us some twenty or thirty to one.
2852010	The Vespid auxiliaries in our Cadre have proven especially effective in this battle. They are able to fly at high speeds through the dense foliage, striking at the enemy and then vanishing again into the canopy. According to Pathfinders observing from cover, these raids regularly drive the Orks into apoplectic fits as they scramble up trees or launch volleys of crude projectiles into the foliage, only to be attacked from another front. The disarray the Vespid cause creates perfect opportunities for barrages from fire warrior teams or crisis suits, or even for close assault by Kroot carnivore teams.
2852011	I am confident we can continue this harrying tactic with minimal loss and slowly drive the Orks south and westward. Actually eliminating these barbarians, however, will require more firepower than my cadre has at its disposal.

2852016	The rise of the Necrons and Dark Crusade War drained resources once a rich Morriah Coast. But for better or for worse, a new deposits was discovered by scouts. And war comes once again to these lands, which are still valuable, although not so rich as in past.
2852018	
2852100	The Green Coast
2852101	The Green Coast has long been the abode of feral Orks and other dangerous beasts. Now it is the heart of Warlord Gorgutz' great Waaagh!, which threatens to spread across all of Kronus and beyond.
2852102	Swamplands
2852103	Riddled with  hundreds of rivers flowing into the warm Southern Sea, the coastline itself is more mirage than reality. Huge expanses of floating vegetation stretch out for miles beyond solid ground, while fetid saltwater swamps stretch inland just as far.
2852104	++ Reconnaissance Report ++
2852105	++ Stealth Team Lonehunter ++
2852106	Be advised that reports from Kor’shi command in close orbit are confirmed. The object that recently impacted the tropical coast of the Rhean Sea was indeed a crude form of transport employed by Ork invaders. Close observation has revealed several salient details:
2852107	The object seems to have been a hollowed out natural asteroid or at the very least is built from a great deal of ferrous ores. Although scarred by entry into the atmosphere and by impact, the object remains a great stone mountain jutting from the marshes of the Green Coast. This is clearly what the Orks refer to as a “rok.”
2852108	The local feral Ork population greeted the impact initially with alarm and aggression, and indeed the tremendous impact destroyed several settlements outright. Close reconnaissance reveals that a large battle occurred shortly after impact, presumably when the rok disgorged its passengers and they were set upon by the surviving feral Orks.
2852109	Aggression between the feral and newcomer Orks has largely abated. The rok apparently housed a powerful chieftain (going by the name Warlord Gorgutz) who has imposed his authority over all Orks in the region.
2852110	This Gorgutz is highly aggressive and seems intent on conquest. Orkish energies in the Green Coast are now focused on readying for a great conquest. The least primitive of the Orks are busy assembling great numbers of vehicles and producing huge stocks of weapons.
2852111	Team Lonehunter will continue to observe and do our best to strike crippling blows where we can, but stopping these barbarians requires a much larger force. Several cadres are called for, including many Kroot teams who can face the Orks in close combat.

2852200	The Deimos Peninsula
2852201	Once an idyllic retreat, the powers of Chaos have twisted and tainted Deimos until it now resembles the darkest reaches of the Warp. They plan to spread this contagion across Kronus.
2852202	Daemon World
2852203	The powers of the Warp have transformed Deimos into an open sore on the surface of Kronus. Blood bubbles from the earth, ruinous energies pulse through the air, and the sky is shrouded in black clouds of plague flies.
2852204	From the Ninth Book of Black Inheritance:
2852205	In the appointed time, Eliphas the Inheritor, Dark Apostle and Bearer of the Word of Chaos Undivided, returned to the soil of the planet Kronus. His will had ever been with this world where he had shed the blood of the deluded followers of the False Emperor, but the Dark Apostle had watched over the world from afar until this glorious night.
2852206	A small cabal of men arrived at the Third Temple of Black Succession in the far south of the Deimos Peninsula. They came aboard a small air vessel, having escaped from the rise of the soulless Necrons in the harsh desert to the north. Driven out of the shackles of reason by their experiences, these men clung to their faith as a beacon of hope. As is right and true, they turned their prayers to the eight-pointed star to bring them and their world salvation.
2852207	One among the men was named Virgilius and was especially faithful. He was  greeted with open arms by the temple’s presbyter, Flavian. Virgilius read frequently from that most holy of texts, The Book of the Epistles of Lorgar, and so knew what must occur. On the eighth night of their visit to the temple, he woke his fellows and asked them to accompany him to the great chamber at the temple’s heart. Virgilius had led them true thus far and so these wretches followed him anew.
2852208	In the chamber, they found their salvation awaiting them. In the configuration of our most holy faith, eight iron pikes stood planted in the stonework. The presbyter and his deacons also awaited in the chamber and when the least true of the men succumbed to fear and attempted to flee, they did take him and place him on the pike at the fourth minor octant. In his screaming he issued the fifteenth curse, which Virgilius and Flavian took to be a most auspicious omen. Soon the other six of Virgilius’ companions had been positioned and their blood ran down the grooves in the temple floor.
2852209	Flavian turned to Virgilius, ready to submit this man if his faith were to falter at the last instant. But he need not have worried, for Virgilius knew the truth of Chaos Undivided and what was required of him. He walked with confident strides to the pike at the first major octant, and stepping upon the shoulder of the prostrate deacon there, climbed upon it and allowed it to bite deep into his flesh. As his weight slid him down the pike, Virgilius extended his hand for the final element and Flavian was quick to provide him with the black blade.
2852210	With a swift motion, Virgilius opened his abdomen to allow his entrails to fall. As the life left him, he saw the warp open between the points of the star and watched Eliphas the Inheritor step forth at last.
2852211	Thus did the Ninth Inheritance begin.

2852300	Victory Bay
2852301	Once the capital city of Kronus, Ironworks Bay stood abandoned and derelict for centuries before the Imperial Guard arrived. They have renamed the city Victory Bay in honor of their coming reconquest of the planet.
2852302	Urban
2852303	The city of Victory Bay itself lies at the northern end of the temperate belt and is prone to long winters and rain much of the rest of the year. The provincial hinterland, however, stretches to the south where agrifarms take advantage of the milder summers.
2852304	++Propaganda Leaflet Dropped In Major Cities of Northeast Kronus++
2852305	Today Is Victory Day!
2852306	Citizens of the Imperium rejoice! Liberation from the yoke of alien domination is at hand! The Emperor who rules us all has sent his brave troops to face the tyrannical despots and mad heretics who have enslaved Kronus and return our world to His Grace.
2852307	The alien invaders from the Tau Empire who stole Kronus from the Imperium have abandoned and neglected the city of Ironworks Bay, your proper capital. They fear the might of the God-Emperor, represented so clearly by the great Hellstorm Cannon that watches over the city. Taken from one of the Emperor’s own great Titan war machines, it is now in Imperial hands once again.
2852308	To mark this first blow for liberation, Ironworks Bay has become Victory Bay by order of Governor-Militant Alexander, leader of the brave soldiers of the Imperial Guard’s 1st Kronus regiment.
2852309	Soon this victory will spread across Kronus as the Liberators strike against the aliens, heretics and traitors who beset this fine world.
2852310	Prepare for that day now! The chains of alien domination are weak and you can break them!
2852311	Take heart in the words of the Governor-Militant, spoken when he arrived on Kronus:
2852312	“Look around you, at the skeletal buildings and the abandoned roads of this once-great city. See in the signs of neglect and just how far this world has strayed from the path set for it by our beloved Emperor. We are here to set this world aright and our first step shall occur right here. The defeat of our enemies begins here on this very day, and so I name this reborn city as Victory Bay. In the Emperor’s Name.”
2852313	
2852314	Revere the Emperor. Honor His Troops. Earn His Grace.
2852315	Victory Day Is Today.
2852400	North Vandea
2852401	Known for its harsh winters and hardy settlers, North Vandea is now home to the Castellum Incorruptus,  a massive fortress from which the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens chapter launch their purge of the planet.
2852402	Mountains
2852403	The coast of North Vandea is battered by cold salt spray while winter snows lash inland. The Blood Ravens have practiced a scorched earth policy in the region, leaving little but barren rock and ice before them.

In order to protect what uncorrupted holy relics may remain on this benighted world, and to prevent any spread of the cancer gripping Kronus, the Chapter Master and Chief Librarian of the Blood Ravens has ordered that a great purge take place. Brother-Captain Davian Thule, commanding elements of the First, Second and Fourth Companies, shall lead this crusade. Standing at his side shall be Chaplain Mikelus and Librarian Anteas.
2852410	Therefore, the Imperial Guard forces serving under General Lukas Alexander and currently dispatched to the planet's surface, are hereby ordered to cease and desist at once, and to evacuate the system forthwith. This order comes under the authority granted to the Space Marines by the Emperor Himself at the dawn of His rule.

3100050	The Battle of Pavonis
3100051	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3100052	For much of the Dark Crusade, great fleets plied the orbital lanes above the battlefields of Kronus, using their firepower to ground long range flights. Guardsman and heretic alike had to fight meter by bloody meter. With great battlefleets exchanging fire across the system, it seemed an immutable fact of life for commanders on the ground.
3100053	All this changed with the Battle of Pavonis. This space port featured an ancient Adeptus Mechanicus tracking system merged with the alien technologies of the Tau Air Caste. This system was sensitive enough to plot courses that avoided orbital fire, making strikes deep into enemy territory possible.
3100054	A Tech-Priest had discovered this technological marvel and left his servitors to examine it in detail. Whichever force was able to recover these bionic servants would gain control of the station and be able to launch strikes attacks Kronus.

3216000	The Soulstorm Campaign
3216001	Welcome to the single-player campaign of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade. These tutorial windows will guide you through the first two turns of play and introduce key features of this all-new campaign mode.
3216002	Your goal is to conquer the Planet Kronus. This world's inhabited continent is divided into twenty-five different provinces. Your conquest of the planet will happen one province at a time.
3216003	The campaign map is your major interface for directing your troops' strategic moves. Individual battles are fought on the smaller-scaled battle map.
3216004	Continue
3217000	Your Stronghold
3217001	This province is your stronghold, or home province. It is from here that you are launching your conquest of Kronus. If your stronghold is ever conquered, you will be pushed from Kronus and lose the campaign.
3217002	Since this is the first turn, this is the only province you currently control.
3217004	Continue
3217005	The enemy factions each have their own strongholds, identified by banners on the campaign map. To win the campaign and make Kronus yours, you must conquer all six of these heavily defended provinces.
3218000	Army
3218001	The figure of your commander indicates the current position of your main army. You can only attack a province that borders the province where your army is, so its position on the map defines your options.
3218002	The enemy factions each have armies of their own and also can only attack adjacent provinces. One of your enemies, however, controls a space port in the Pavonis province. He can attack all over the map.
3218004	Continue
3219000	Moving and Attacking
3219001	These arrows show you where your army can move or attack this turn. Red arrows indicate attacks into enemy provinces. Green arrows indicate moves into friendly provinces.
3219002	Since this is your first turn, and you only control your stronghold, you must attack an enemy province.
3219003	To move to or attack a province, left-click to select that province and then click on the Attack or Move button in the right panel. We should begin by attacking an enemy province. Select the province you want to attack and click the Attack button.
3219004	Left-clicking on a province always brings up these arrows (unless you have no more moves left this turn).
3219005	OK
3219006	Continue
3220000	The Attack Screen
3220001	This screen shows you the forces you are leading into an attack and allows you to return to the campaign map if you decide you want to attack later.
3220002	Since this is your first attack, most options aren't yet available.
3220003	When you're ready to attack, just click on the Attack button. This will take you to the battle map, where you will face enemies in a game of Dawn of War.
3220004	OK
3220005	Continue
3221000	The Wargear Screen
3221001	As you conquer more and more provinces, you'll be awarded pieces of special equipment for your commander. This equipment is called wargear.
3221002	You will never be awarded a specific piece of wargear. Instead, for each award, you get to choose one piece from the list on this screen. (Note that you may have to get some pieces of wargear to unlock other, more powerful versions.)
3221003	OK
3221004	Continue
3222000	Victory and Rewards
3222001	Congratulations! You have conquered your first province. This victory has given you several rewards, including a piece of wargear and the bonus from the province.
3222002	Every province on the map has a special bonus. This bonus is displayed in the right-hand panel when you select the province.
3222003	Some provinces give you the ability to train a special unit for your commander's honor guard. Once trained, these units accompany your commander into the initial stages of battle. You can train these units (or retrain them if they are destroyed in battle) from the Commander Screen or the Attack Screen.
3222004	Other provinces give you special abilities, like the Eres Badlands which gives you the ability to attack twice per turn.
3222005	OK
3222006	Continue
3223000	Conquered Provinces
3223001	This is the province you've just conquered. Notice that it has changed to your color and that your army is now here. Whenever you conquer a province, your army moves to that province.
3223002	You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn, new provinces will be available for you to attack.
3223003	When you are ready to let the enemy factions act, click on the End Turn button.
3223004	OK
3223005	Continue
3224000	Defeat
3224001	The enemy repelled your attack on the province.
3224002	You can only move or attack once per turn, so your turn is effectively over. Next turn you will be able to attack again and avenge yourself.
3224004	OK
3224005	Continue
3225000	The Enemy's Turn
3225001	Each of the enemy factions will now act in turn. Like you, they each have their own strongholds and armies. They will each move their armies or attack and reinforce their provinces in turn.
3225002	Pay attention to where your enemies' armies are. Armies will reinforce nearby friendly provinces under attack, bolstering the defense with additional troops.
3225003	OK
3225004	Continue
3226000	Defending Your Provinces
3226001	One of your provinces is under attack.
3226002	You can choose to fight on the battle map or to auto-resolve this battle. Auto-resolving can be dangerous, however, since it depends on the relative strength of your province and the attacker's forces. You always have a better chance of winning if you fight the battle yourself. There are also pieces of wargear that can only be earned by fighting defensive battles on the battle map, so you should think carefully before auto-resolving.
3226003	If you choose to fight and your army is on the province or one that neighbors it, your commander and his honor guard will join the defense. If not, you'll have to make do with whatever forces are garrisoned there.
3226004	OK
3226005	Continue
3227000	Planetary Requisition
3227001	It is now your turn to act again.
3227002	You'll notice that you have gained Planetary Requisition from the provinces you control. Each province produces Planetary Requisition every turn.
3227003	You use Planetary Requisition to reinforce your provinces by stationing troops there and to train honor guard units.
3227004	To reinforce a province, simply left-click on a province you own and then click on the Reinforce button in the right-hand panel.
3227005	OK
3227006	Continue
3228000	Reinforcing Provinces
3228001	This screen allows you to garrison troops in a province. These troops will be ready when you fight to defend this province from enemy attacks.
3228002	Stationing troops in a province costs you Planetary Requisition. The available units are on the panel.
3228003	Later, you can recall these troops (if the province is no longer at risk). Recalling a unit will give you back half the Planetary Requisition you spent to station it in the first place.
3228004	Be careful. All your purchases will be final once you accept the changes on this screen.
3228005	Continue
3229000	The Commander Screen
3229001	This screen provides you with a snapshot of your progress in conquering the Planet Kronus. It includes a running tally of your conquests, your commander's statistics, your honor guard and more.
3229002	If you haven't yet trained an honor guard unit (or you've lost one in battle), you can train it on this screen by simply clicking on its icon.
3229003	You can also access the Wargear Screen from here.
3229004	OK
3229005	Continue
3230000	Defeating an Enemy
3230001	Congratulations. You have just conquered an enemy race's stronghold. This victory ends that race's attempt to take the planet. If you can conquer the five remaining enemy strongholds, you will win the game.
3230002	There may still be some provinces held by the defeated race, but without a stronghold they no longer have an army or the ability to attack.
3230003	You can mop up their remaining provinces to gain the associated bonuses, or you can move on to other targets.
3230004	OK
3230005	Continue
3232000	Fury
3232001	You have conquered the Eres Badlands and gained the Fury special ability.
3232002	Fury gives you two full moves per turn, instead of just one. Just like before, you can use each one to move your army to a neighboring province you control or to attack a neighboring enemy province.
3232003	This ability is available right away so you can attack a second time this turn or move your army from the Eres Badlands before ending your turn.
3232004	OK
3232005	Continue
3233000	Bulwark
3233001	You have conquered the Ariel Highlands and gained the Bulwark special ability.
3233002	Bulwark makes it cheaper for you to reinforce your provinces. This cost savings is applied automatically.
3233003	OK
3233004	Continue
3234000	Forward Base
3234001	You have conquered the Hyperion Peaks and gained the Forward Base special ability.
3234002	When you attack a province, you will now be able to purchase structures from the Attack Screen. Each structure costs Planetary Requisition and appears immediately when you arrive on the battle map.
3234003	OK
3234004	Continue
3235000	Space Port
3235001	You have conquered Pavonis and gained the Space Port special ability.
3235002	The Space Port allows you to move your army around the campaign map much more freely. Instead of moving to or attacking only adjacent provinces, you can move to or attack almost any province on the map.
3235003	The Space Port does not allow you to attack a distant stronghold, however. To attack an enemy stronghold, you still have to do so from a neighboring province.
3235004	OK
3235005	Continue
3236000	Industrial Production
3236001	You have conquered the Vandean Coast and gained the Industrial Production special ability.
3236002	When you fight on the battle map, you will start with additional Requisition, allowing you to produce units and structures more quickly.
3236003	When you fight on the battle map, you will start with additional Power, allowing you to produce units and structures more quickly.
3236004	OK
3236005	Continue
3237000	Increased Manpower
3237001	You have conquered the Aceria Forests and gained the Increased Manpower special ability.
3237002	When you fight on the battle map, you will start with an increased Squad Cap and Vehicle Cap, allowing you to field a larger force.
3237003	OK

3503100	To Wake the Refineries
3503101	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3503102	Once a thriving industrial center, by the beginning of the Dark Crusade, the Vandean Coast had fallen into disuse. Some factories in the cities were still operational, but other great underground refineries languished under the sands of the coast, long-since abandoned as unnecessary by the planet's Tau masters.
3503103	As the Crusade dragged on, however, these ancient factories suddenly became very valuable. The warring factions could ensure their armies' supplies by taking the Vandean Coast and waking the refineries' dormant machine spirits. Weeks of fighting raged in Vandea, while workers channeled massive amounts of power into great capacitors to power-up the long-disused factories.
3503104	Whoever gained control of the coast would enjoy a powerful advantage for the rest of the crusade. With such potent manufacturing facilities, field commanders could requisition more weapons than their foes.

3550100	The Return of Eliphas
3550101	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550102	The powers of Chaos manifested in the once-pleasant Deimos Peninsula on the southern coast of Kronus, transforming it into a blasted hellscape. Summoned by heretical cultists, the Black Apostle Eliphas the Inheritor emerged from the Warp leading a whole company of the Word Bearers Chaos Legion.
3550103	These heretical Space Marines had been to Kronus before, fighting against their loyal brothers during the dark days of the Horus Heresy. Eliphas had been but a young Champion then, but returned a terrible Chaos Lord, ready to bring ruin to the Galaxy at large. The Dark Crusade would be his proving ground. By defeating the many powers vying for the planet, he sought to gain favor with the dark gods he worshipped.
3550104	Unless they could be stopped then and there, the Word Bearers would strike deeper into the Imperium.
3550110	For the Prince of Excess
3550111	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550112	The Eldar of Craftworld Biel-Tan came to Kronus pursuing their alien agendas, but in the end did nothing but feed the power of the Chaos Lord Eliphas the Inheritor. Despite her use of Orkish servants and even a rival Chaos cult, the witch Taldeer was unable to hold back Eliphas’s forces, who cut her off from her vessel and subjected her people to the most terrible of fates.
3550113	To celebrate his victory over the Eldar, Eliphas had his men crack open all the aliens’ waystones. According to the black texts circulated after this dark day, these eldritch gems held the souls of the Eldar, keeping them from feeding the powers of Chaos. By breaking the waystones, the Word Bearers fed thousands of Eldar souls to Slaanesh, the Chaos God of Excess and Decadence, and obtained that dark deity’s favor for their Dark Crusade.
3550120	For the Lord of Decay
3550121	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550122	Governor-Militant Alexander’s naming of his capital proved highly premature, as Victory Bay saw his troops broken and slaughtered by the powers of Chaos. Eliphas the Inheritor led an unholy procession through the streets of the shattered city, his cultists shouting out terrible supplications and gathering up the dead and wounded.
3550123	These unfortunates were brought before the great Hellstorm cannon that had formed the center of the Imperial defense. Eliphas’s sorcerers, Amphion and Zethus, then performed a terrifying ritual using these rotting corpses as their sacrifice. With their dark words, the daemon of plague and rot bound into the cannon during the Horus Heresy awoke anew. The Word Bearers celebrated this day as that when their new crusade obtained the support of Nurgle, the Chaos God of Pestilence and Decay.
3550130	For the Changer of the Ways
3550131	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550132	Faithful subjects of the Emperor understandably took heart to see the Word Bearers strike at the heart of the Necron infestation of Kronus. With two implacable evils turning on one another, the thinking went, the forces of right couldn't help but win. Unfortunately, Eliphas the Inheritor would emerge from his victory in the Thur’Abis Plateau more dangerous than ever.
3550133	Imperial commanders could not guess that the Necrons held strange technologies and artifacts that were as hateful to the powers of Chaos as they were to life itself. By shattering the basalt monoliths and unholy archives of the Necrons, Eliphas was striking at one of the only forces (other than the God Emperor Himself) able to push back the ruinous powers. In so doing, he not only removed a threat to his power, but gained the favor of Tzeentch, one of the Chaos Gods of the Warp. His Dark Crusade would carry the sanction of the God of Sorcery from that day onward, making it all the more unstoppable.
3550140	For the Blood God
3550141	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550142	The massed Ork clans threw their full might against the tide of the Word Bearers, but in the battle between heretic and alien, the blasphemers triumphed. Indeed, as is their way, the forces of Chaos sowed dissent and conflict among the Orks. The once-unified band of Warlord Gorgutz fell into fractious infighting just when he faced the Warp-powered heretics.
3550143	The slaughter that ensued was of epic proportions, but Eliphas the Inheritor’s true objective was simpler. The Black Apostle recovered from Gorgutz the skull of Crull, the Butcher of Lorn V. This debased heretic had led the so-called Blood Legion of Khorne and faced the Imperial Guard’s 412th Cadian regiment. Eliphas claimed his severed head for Khorne’s “skull throne,” obtaining in this way the favor of the most terrible of the Chaos Gods.
3550150	For the Warmaster
3550151	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550152	The Word Bearers’ victory over the Blood Ravens Space Marines was a terrible blow to the Emperor’s faithful. The Ravens fought nearly to the last and blasted the landscape with orbital fire rather than see their relics fall into heretical hands, but their sacrifices ultimately seemed in vain.
3550153	Indeed, Eliphas the Inheritor saw North Vandea as the site of his most critical victory. Mad preachers took to the streets of Kronus’s cities claiming that, by breaking the Blood Ravens, the Word Bearers had obtained the personal sanction of Warmaster Abbadon for their Dark Crusade. It was never clear why the deaths of Blood Ravens – a chapter whose history does not go back to the Horus Heresy – would be especially pleasing to Abbadon. Nevertheless, the forces of the Word Bearers fought with a new and terrible certainty from that point on.
3550160	For the Primarch Lorgar
3550161	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550162	Eliphas the Inheritor’s defeat of the alien forces of the Tau Empire led to a twisted parody of Inquisitorial practices. The Word Bearers celebrated the death of Aun'el Shi'ores and pointed to the Ethereal's demise as evidence of the falsehood of Tau idols. The heretical propaganda surrounding this event saw the Word Bearers spitting back at the world the same accusations used to damn them. They called the Tau heretics and infidels, faithless creatures who worshipped empty ideals under the boots of the hierophantic Ethereal caste.
3550163	These acts were all directed at pleasing Lorgar, the Word Bearers' Primarch who is said to rule the Legion from the Daemon World of Sicarus. The founder of the twisted faith preached by his Legion, Lorgar is said to hate the irreligious above all others. If so, it is not hard to imagine him smiling over the slaughter carried out in his name in the Tau cities of Kronus.
3550170	The Crusade Continues
3550171	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550172	By the end of the Second Kronus War, the foul banner of the Word Bearers flew across the entire planet. The very earth cracked with the foul energies unleashed there, Warp storms wracked the sky, and daemons spread across the land. Where once a prosperous colony had stood, a foul Daemon World burned like a canker in the void. Black Cathedrals rose in all its cities and the entire population either converted to the blasphemous faith of Chaos Undivided or became fodder for its blood sacrifices.
3550173	The loss of a single world and a few hundred million souls would soon pale in comparison to Eliphas’s next acts, however. Soon after his final victory on Kronus, his sorcerers called forth legions of daemons and other foul beasts, while Chaos fleets appeared from the Warp. Kronus became the launching point for a campaign of conquest that would cut through much of Ultima Segmentum as it drove toward Holy Terra itself.
3550174	The War for Kronus was but the dawn of the Imperium’s darkest day.
3550200	The Witch of Biel-Tan
3550201	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550202	In the depths of Craftworld Biel-Tan, the Eldar Farseer Taldeer foresaw the return of the Necrons and their campaign of galactic genocide. She had driven the Imperial Guard on Lorn V against this ancient foe, but the threat remained real.
3550203	When the Necrons arose on Kronus, Taldeer faced a new problem. This planet on the galaxy’s edge was beyond the reach of the Eldar webway. Instead of traveling from the Craftworld via this ancient system, Taldeer’s forces arrived aboard her wraithship, the Vision of Lileath. This alien vessel hid at the edge of the system while an advance party took a small shuttle to the frozen wastes of Tyrea. There, they erected special gateways linked to the holds of the Vision of Lileath.
3550204	The Eldar found the planet in a sorry state. The Necrons were on the march and the assortment of other powers on Kronus could not be trusted to stop them. Abandoning her habitual manipulations, Taldeer ordered her forces to begin an all out conquest of Kronus.
3550205	If none of the Mon-Keigh would stop the Necrons, the Eldar would do it themselves.
3550210	In Cleansing Fire
3550211	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550212	Although the Necrons were Farseer Taldeer’s true prey, the Eldar hatred for the ruinous powers of Chaos was almost as great. Legends hold that the Chaos god Slaanesh was born from the fall of the original Eldar civilization, and Taldeer’s followers were anxious to beat back the human heretics who worshipped such a creature.
3550213	Taldeer’s most senior Aspect Warriors led the drive into the Deimos Peninsula, singing the name of the Eldar war god Kaela Mensha Khaine as they cut through the madmen, traitor Space Marines and daemonic filth arrayed against them. With the Chaos Gates closed and the Word Bearers broken, Taldeer ordered her Aspect Warriors to withdraw. Her Warlocks then performed a great cleansing rite. From orbit, kilometer-long runes appeared in bright fire, announcing the Eldar victory for all to see.
3550220	The Governor’s End
3550221	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550222	Taldeer’s manipulation of the Imperial Guard on Lorn V had resulted in her branding as an enemy of the Imperium. General Lukas Alexander had led his troops against her ever since. When the Farseer at last sent her troops into Victory Bay, both sides knew that this long chase was finally over. Alexander’s men fought with bravery until the end, but the Eldar’s combination of stealth, speed and alien ruthlessness overwhelmed them. The hunt for Farseer Taldeer ended with the swing of an alien blade.
3550223	The Techpriests in Victory Bay sabotaged the great Hellstorm cannon there, lest it fall into Eldar hands, but the Farseer still ordered her Bonesingers and Guardians to load the mighty gun with distort charges. When these Warp-powered weapons detonated, they shattered the cannon into countless pieces. If there was any hope at all of ever restoring this mighty weapon to the Emperor’s service, the Eldar dashed it forever.
3550230	Remains of the Dead
3550231	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550232	Farseer Taldeer personally led her forces into the catacombs of the Necrons and delivered the massive plasma bomb that collapsed the catacombs, bringing tons of rock down on her foes and many of her own warriors. Perhaps to atone for this, she also led the efforts to recover the remains of the fallen.
3550233	During this somber triage, Taldeer uncovered the Tomb of the Lost, a crypt built eons ago by the Necrons to enshrine the remains of their victims. Within were the remains of several ancient Eldar, warriors in the first war against the Necrons. Taldeer would return these to Biel-Tan with great ceremony.
3550234	Perhaps it was the presence of such antediluvian relics that drove the Farseer to complete her conquest of Kronus. Even with the Necrons defeated, she drove her forces forward into the territories as yet unconquered. No rock could be left unturned, she said, lest the Necrons rise anew on this world.
3550240	Jungle Games
3550241	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550242	Taldeer’s forces struck like a razor-sharp blade into the heart of the great Orkish horde, decapitating the Waaagh! and plunging the remaining Orks into destructive infighting. Showing their contempt for the brutish warriors, the main Eldar force withdrew from the Green Coast immediately after it had disposed of Warlord Gorgutz.
3550243	Only a small cadre of Rangers and a single Warlock remained in the jungle, using their cameleoline cloaks and other devices to remain hidden from the warring clans. Any time a chieftain seemed to be gaining enough stature to assemble the Orks into a viable force, the Rangers assassinated him, plunging the wild aliens into another cycle of infighting. Meanwhile, the Warlock Enimiah (a member of Taldeer’s Seer Council) repeatedly offered poisonous aid to various Ork chiefs, sending them at each others’ throats and keeping the race as a whole weak.
3550250	Ravens’ Fall
3550251	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550252	The Eldar assault on North Vandea broke the back of the Blood Ravens presence on Kronus. Not only did Taldeer’s forces kill many of the finest warriors in the chapter, but they claimed many of the relics the Blood Ravens were so anxious to hide. Although Chaplain Mikelus sacrificed himself to destroy at least some of the chapter’s dark secrets, others fell into Eldar hands.
3550253	Taldeer’s warlocks treatment of the corpses of fallen Space Marines was even more galling to the surviving Blood Ravens. As if expecting them to be the source of some pestilence, the alien sorcerers incinerated every last Blood Raven body left in North Vandea. This made any planned operations to return to Kronus and recover the gene-seed from the fallen battle-brothers pointless.
3550254	The chapter vowed revenge for the loss of its valuable gene stock.
3550260	Madness in Asharis
3550261	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550262	The Eldar assault on Asharis pitted speed against speed and stealth against stealth. Ultimately, it was the ancient sorceries of Taldeer and her Seer Council that prevailed over the alien technologies of the Tau defenders. The death of the Tau’s Ethereal ruler broke their morale and Taldeer simply allowed Shas’o Kais to withdraw from Kronus.
3550263	The Eldar showed utter contempt for their enemies and simply left Asharis to its fate once the Tau had withdrawn. In the wake of the battle, humans freed from centuries of alien bondage took to the streets and exacted some measure of justice upon the Tau civilians left behind. Revenge led to madness and soon Asharis was ablaze, Farseer Taldeer having as much concern for the lives lost there as a man might for the ants under his feet.
3550270	Ghosts of Tyrea
3550271	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550272	The alien mind is strange and mysterious, and Farseer Taldeer proved this once again upon her conquest of Kronus. The Eldar had broken all who stood before them, driving back men, alien and heretics alike. Kronus was theirs. However, instead of securing their hold on the world or enacting some final gambit, they simply vanished, like the ghosts of legend.
3550273	The Eldar returned to their ship, the Vision of Lileath, which evaded all attempts to track its exit from the Kronus system. Taldeer left behind her a planet in anarchy, littered with the corpses of her enemies and destined to become a lawless backwater for centuries to come. Perhaps that had been her intention all along; perhaps Kronus itself, and the warlords who might have arisen there, were the threat Taldeer had long foreseen and finally defeated.
3550274	The truth, like the Farseer’s ultimate fate, remains a mystery.
3550300	A New Cause
3550301	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550302	The Imperial Guard arrived on Kronus in pursuit of the Eldar Farseer Taldeer. General Lukas Alexander found more than his prey there, however. He found his destiny.
3550303	General Alexander claimed the abandoned city of Ironworks Bay as a base of operations and found there the massive Hellstorm cannon of an Imperator war titan. Techpriests had brought this fearsome relic to Kronus millennia ago, soon after it was cut from a heretical war machine during the Horus Heresy.
3550304	When the General reported his discovery, the Imperial Guard's high command issued him new orders. He would secure the titan's gun along with any other relics of the Techpriests, and would then return Kronus to the Imperium of Man. Ordering him to drive out the aliens and heretics besetting this world, Segmentum Command named Alexander Governor-Militant and created the 1st Kronus Regiment from his ground forces. The new Governor quickly renamed the city itself Victory Bay, making it his new planetary capital, while his men adopted the sobriquet of "Liberators" for their regiment.
3550305	When the Blood Ravens Space Marines began their purge of Kronus, the Governor-Militant refused to retreat. His orders were clear, regardless of the demands of the Space Marines. The Guard would fight the Blood Ravens along with all the other invaders.
3550310	The Daemon Killers
3550311	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550312	The Liberators’ 3rd Company provided the bulk of Governor-Militant Alexander’s troops during the final assault on the Word Bearers’ warp gate. This choice was astute, as 3rd Company had been drawn from the Cadian 15th regiment and were veterans of several hard battles against Chaos forces on their home world.
3550313	The men of Third Company did their duty admirably, despite having to fight across warp-blasted terrain and face countless twisted horrors. In the wake of the bloody battle, the company came to be known as the “Daemon Killers,” but scores of men left their lives on that corrupted soil, and many more were maimed and wounded. The toll of the battle was higher still among the sanctioned psykers supporting the troops. The presence of so much unbridled warp energy drove many to madness or to loose control over their strange abilities. The regimental commissariat oversaw the execution of those lost to the enemy.
3550320	The Witch’s End
3550321	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550322	No amount of trickery or deceit could forestall the Emperor’s justice when the Liberators finally tracked Farseer Taldeer to the frozen terrain of Tyrea. With the witch’s web gates sealed and her forces crushed, Governor-Militant Alexander soon held the xeno Farseer in his hands. Drugged and imprisoned, she would ultimately be handed over to the Inquisition.
3550323	Taldeer’s capture meant Governor Alexander's original mission was at an end. However, in a rousing speech before the troops in Tyrea – and broadcast across the planet – Alexander reminded his soldiers of their duty to return Kronus to Imperial control. Father Martel, the Governor’s own confessor, blessed this mandate in the name of the Immortal God Emperor, and the regimental Commissars called it the duty of all loyal Guardsmen to push on to total victory.
3550330	Into the Valley of Death
3550331	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550332	The terrifying battle through the underground labyrinth of the Necron catacombs cost the Liberators dearly. The implacable foe claimed scores upon scores of lives, notably wiping out 4th Company’s 2nd and 5th platoons. But when the smoke cleared from the great detonation which collapsed the catacombs, a great cheer arose from the survivors.
3550333	In several places, the ancient structures of the Necron tomb world emerged from the desert. Father Martel, confessor to the Governor and the de facto arch-deacon of Kronus, ultimately condemned these as heretical blights which continued to corrupt all those who spent time near them. Governor-Militant Alexander took his words to heart and had his men use further bombs to reduce all ruins to rubble or bury them under tons of sand.
3550340	Skull Hunting
3550341	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550342	Despite the legions of aliens he threw against the Liberators, Warlord Gorgutz could not stand against the might of the Imperial Guard. The Ork chieftain’s escape would later put a blemish on the victory in the Green Coast, but in the immediate aftermath, most assumed he had died in the cataclysmic explosion that destroyed his encampment.
3550343	Governor-Militant Alexander entrusted the job of cleaning up the now divided Orks to Captain Gregor Vash’s 2nd Company. Vash broke his forces up into individual hunter squads, offering rewards and glory to those units that confirmed the most kills. The Ogryns under his command took this contest to heart and collected massive piles of Orkish skulls for themselves. The company commissar eventually forbade this practice as incompatible with the Imperial creed. He spent some weeks in the madicae temple after informing the Ogryn warriors of his decision.
3550350	Resolved in Blood
3550351	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550352	The clash between Governor-Militant Alexander and the Blood Raven Captain Thule could only end in blood. Both had explicit orders, and both were convinced they acted with the Emperor's blessing. Only when the Liberators had driven into North Vandea and leveled the Space Marines’ Castellum Incorruptus did the Blood Ravens cease their purge of the planet and withdraw.
3550353	Although orbital salvos from the Blood Ravens’ battle barge leveled much of the remains of the base, Governor Alexander directed his men to conduct a careful search for any records the Space Marines might have left behind. Their search was not in vain, and Alexander uncovered records linking the chapter to past visits to the planet, as well as disturbing contradictions in the chapter’s history. It seems likely that these discoveries led directly to the Inquisition’s probe of the chapter soon thereafter.
3550360	The Liberation of Asharis
3550361	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550362	Certainly one of the most hard-fought, the Imperial victory over the Tau forces in Asharis was definitely the most celebrated of the liberation campaign. In the death of the Ethereal Shi’ores and the retreat of his forces, Governor-Militant Alexander saw the completion of his dream of once and for all stripping Kronus from the Tau Empire.
3550363	A military parade through the streets of Asharis marked the victory, along with repeated scenes of sanctioned destruction of the signs of alien occupation. The regimental commissariat also established offices in Asharis and other liberated cities where citizens could provide information on those who had aided the alien occupiers. The trials of accused collaborators were rapid and deadly, the Emperor’s justice having no mercy for traitors to the human race.
3550370	A Power to Be Reckoned With
3550371	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550372	With the last alien bastion broken, Governor-Militant Alexander stood as the uncontested ruler of Kronus and a hero to his men. Even faced with the opposition of the Blood Ravens, the Governor carried out his orders and received his rewards. Indeed, Segmentum Command ordered the Liberators to remain on Kronus during a pacification period and then to ship out to the next conflict zone. Governor Alexander would remain behind to rule in the God Emperor’s name.
3550373	Large numbers of Techpriests arrived on Kronus to oversee a massive campaign of public works, bringing with them the huge resources needed. In return, they gained permission to resume study of the Hellstorm cannon in Victory Bay, hoping to return it to the Emperor’s service.
3550374	As for the Liberators, Governor Alexander promoted Captain Vash to colonel and placed him in command. With the regiment still loyal to him, a planet at his command, and the Techpriests of Mars in his debt, Lukas Alexander had begun his rise as a power to be reckoned with in this sector of the galaxy.
3550400	Hunger of the Nightbringer
3550401	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550402	The Necrons had lain buried in the sands of Kronus for eons, having retreated there at the end of a great war only hinted at in the histories of ancient races like the Eldar. Long before Man even stood upright, the Necrons and their dark gods had retreated to their tomb worlds.
3550403	But their slumber was not eternal. Eventually their genocidal deities awoke them again, driving them to purge the life that had spread across the galaxy during their sleep. On Kronus, this awakening came when an archeological team opened a mysterious crypt on the arid Thur’Abis Plateau. Most of the team died, but expedition leader Tomas Macabee somehow became one of the mysterious Necron Pariahs. Seemingly retaining a hint of his personality, he occasionally spoke for the silent army as it advanced.
3550404	The Necron Lord of Kronus, the most ancient and powerful of the deathless creatures on the planet, promptly launched a campaign of extermination. His loathsome god, the Nightbringer, hungered for the deaths of all those on Kronus.
3550410	Doom of the Warp Gods
3550411	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550412	In the most ancient of Eldar myth cycles, there are tales of the Necrons’ bloodthirsty deities clashing with the powers of the Warp. Thus, the Necron assault on the Chaos stronghold was something of a reenactment of that prehistoric war, the merciless wave of the material Necrons clashing with the unbridled madness of the Immaterium.
3550413	Despite black sorceries and the rage of foul daemons, even the Traitor Space Marines could not stop the unending tide of Necrons. The Nightbringer’s servants remained in Deimos for some time after their victory, seemingly focused on purging the very soil there, which had been tainted by the power of the Warp. Necron gauss weaponry atomized every last Chaos temple and artifact left, not to mention all the corpses and the unfortunates who survived the initial attack. By the time the Necrons moved to their next target, the peninsula had become a scorched desert of ash and dust.
3550420	A Pyre of Wraithbone
3550421	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550422	The Eldar had come to Kronus specifically to face the Necrons and when the deathless army marched into Tyrea, they got their chance. For all the lauded foresight of their Farseer, however, the Eldar were unable to stem the Necron tide and fell under the power of their weapons. The dreams of Craftworld Biel-Tan came crashing down under the metallic heel of their ancient enemies.
3550423	The Necrons directed much of their energy to destroying the various wraithbone structures left by the Eldar. This eldritch material is said to emanate directly from the Warp, which seems to have offended the deathless warriors even more than the existence of life. The thin spires built by the Eldar collapsed as gauss flares and alien blades cut them into their atomic components. Only when the works of Farseer Taldeer were blasted to nothing did the Necron tide move on.
3550430	The Fall of Man
3550431	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550432	Imperial forces had faced Necrons before, notably on Lorn V and Verdus Prime, and it had cost the champions of Man dearly each time. On Kronus, things only got harder, and when the Necron forces swept into Victory Bay, even the raw power of the revived Hellstorm cannon could not stop them.
3550433	The Necrons showed cold contempt for the works of Man as they murdered the last Techpriests and Guardsmen in Victory Bay. With none left to fear them and none left to die, they simply moved on to the next conquest. The remains of the great Titan gun they ignored altogether, even its mighty power paling in comparison to the galactic genocide their gods demanded.
3550440	The Scorched Earth
3550441	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550442	Two unrelenting tides crashed into one another as the Necrons moved into the Green Coast. Imperial citizens can be forgiven for rejoicing to see the barbaric Orkish horde face the merciless advance of the ancient death-bringers. No matter who won, however, the cause of Man suffered. And when the Necron scythe decapitated the Ork horde, it was only one step on their march of galactic extermination.
3550443	Orkish hordes are notoriously difficult to eradicate since the beasts reproduce at a phenomenal rate. Indeed, Kronus’s jungles had been the domain of feral Orks long before Warlord Gorgutz arrived. The Necrons, however, applied their murderous resoluteness here as well and systematically purged the jungle one step at a time. Millions of Orks ultimately perished, each death a pleasing sacrifice for the Nightbringer.
3550450	The Doom of the Blood Ravens
3550451	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550452	Even the elite of the Blood Ravens could not hold back the murderous advance of the Necrons. The Necrons answered the Space Marines' shouted benedictions with stoic silence and murderous blasts from their gauss flayers. The aliens were uninterested in any arcane secrets that might have been hidden in North Vandea, utterly ignoring the scorched ruins of the Blood Ravens chapel there. Their gruesome warriors flensed the flesh from every Space Marine left on the planet, but left their holy battle armors and other relics to corrode in the harsh weather.
3550453	Tragically, among the flesh reduced to particulate ash was the gene-seed of those Space Marines, dealing a near fatal blow to the chapter. By taking North Vandea, the Necrons defeated the Blood Ravens on Kronus. But by purging the genetic heritage of all those fallen battle brothers, they may well have destroyed the whole chapter.
3550460	Purge of the Young
3550461	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550462	In the clash between the young Tau Empire and the ancient evil of the Necrons, antediluvian determination won out over youthful exuberance. For all the tactical skill of Commander O’Kais, the Necron wave was unstoppable and they purged Asharis just as they had all other regions before it.
3550463	The retreat of the Tau forces left the remaining civilian population of Asharis unprotected from the Necron purge. Once their cold-blooded slaughter completed, however, the Necrons simply abandoned the city and its surrounding communities to the ages. Automated vid-systems still broadcast images from the desolate streets, the bleached bones of Tau, Kroot and humans lying still in the ash-strewn streets.
3550464	Somewhere in the depths of the void, the Nightbringer surely smiles at his gruesome handiwork.
3550470	The Tomb World Rises
3550471	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550472	By the end of the Dark Crusade, Kronus was a tomb world once more. Just as the marching Necron armies cut down all their opponents, so do did other fiendish devices work on the planet's very ecosystem. Scarab swarms scoured the lush jungles of the south and the fertile plains of the north, while pulses of loathsome energy killed even microscopic bacteria. The seas died and the air itself became rarified and poisoned. Soon sterile sand and dust swept across the Kronusian landscape, broken only by black monuments to the Nightbringer.
3550473	Kronus became the black heart of the Necron purge in the eastern edge of the galaxy. Warriors emerging from the monoliths of Kronus would bring death to worlds across the Tau Empire, the domains of Ultramar and many more sectors. Imperial strike fleets, Tau battle formations and Eldar raiding teams would all try to retake Kronus, only to fall before the huge crypt vessels protecting the tomb world from orbit. Each heroic effort only added more deaths to the Nightbringer’s tally.
3550500	Rise of the Green Tide
3550501	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550502	Driven from Lorn V, the Ork Warboss Gorgutz Headhunter managed to return as a greater threat still during the Dark Crusade. He formed a new warband from Ork freebooters and pirates and others pushed out of the Lorn system, and set about raiding worlds on the outskirts of the Tau Empire, gaining resources along the way. When Kronus sent out desperate calls for help against the Necrons, Gorgutz sent his forces to strike at a vulnerable target.
3550503	Gorgutz's war fleet dropped out of the Warp, only to find Imperial and Tau fleets squaring off above Kronus. The Orks lost several ships, but the clashing fleets were unable to repel the large number of roks Gorgutz threw into the atmosphere. These massive landing ships, made from converted asteroids, smashed into the Green Coast and unloaded their bands of Ork invaders. There, Gorgutz brought the local feral Orks to heel and set about his conquest.
3550504	The Waaagh! had come to Kronus.
3550510	Gorgutz Daemonkilla
3550511	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550512	On Lorn V, Warlord Gorgutz had clashed with the Chaos Lord Crull, and that experience served him well when he sent his horde into the Deimos Peninsula. Although huge numbers of Orks fell to the foul daemons and black sorceries of the Word Bearers, Gorgutz had plenty to spare and eventually overwhelmed the heretics.
3550513	Gorgutz mounted the skulls of Black Apostle Eliphas and his sorcerers on pikes and had them carried as grisly standards for his Waaagh. The other Orkish chieftains, as ever imitating their warlord, promptly went on an orgy of decapitation, mounting the heads of the countless cultists and Chaos Space Marines left dead when Eliphas withdrew.
3550514	In the wake of this victory, Gorgutz assumed the name of Daemonkilla.
3550520	Gorgutz Ghostkilla
3550521	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550522	Faced with the Ork horde, Farseer Taldeer was perhaps too wily for her own good. Gorgutz was more than happy to cut through the rebellious Orkish chieftain and self-obsessed heretic she used as dupes. Smashing the gates to the Eldar wraithship, Gorgutz caught the Farseer in a simple noose and strangled her with it.
3550523	On Lorn V, Gorgutz had tried and failed to claim Taldeer’s head, but this time he succeeded. As the fragile bodies of the Eldar lay broken across the frozen soil of Tyrea, the warlord and his horde howled at the night sky. Unable to make any real use of Eldar technology, Gorgutz’s beasts simply destroyed every  piece of wraithbone they could find.
3550524	In the wake of this grand sacking, Gorgutz assumed the name Ghostkilla.
3550530	Gorgutz Gunsmasha
3550531	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550532	Gorgutz had suffered at the hands of the Imperial Guard on Lorn V and saw his assault on Victory Bay as a chance for revenge. Unfortunately, Governor-Militant Alexander and his 1st Kronus Liberators were unable to deny Gorgutz his want. The Ork tide swept through the desolate city, spilling the blood of men with virtual impunity.
3550533	When the smoke cleared, Gorgutz and his Ork meks faced the remains of the great Hellstorm cannon, severely damaged by the desperate last acts of the Techpriests of Victory Bay. Unconcerned with the heresy they enacted, the Ork Mek Boyz scavenged every last component from the great circuits, using and abusing them to add power to their primitive guns and vehicles.
3550534	In the wake of this battle, Gorgutz assumed the name Gunsmasha.
3550540	Gorgutz Deathkilla
3550541	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550542	Accustomed to the vilest of environments, Gorgutz’ Orks ran headlong into the gruesome catacombs of the Necrons. Although the deathless warriors reaped a massive bounty in Orkish lives, for once it was they who were swept under a ceaseless tide as more and more of the green beasts poured into the caverns. When Gorgutz detonated the massive explosive that brought down the caverns atop the Necrons, he left scores of his boyz to be crushed.
3550543	Nevertheless the survivors cheered their boss, even laughing at the ruthlessness with which he had sacrificed their fellows. Gorgutz Headhunter left the Thur’Abis Plateau without any fresh skulls, but with the new appellation of Deathkilla.
3550550	Gorgutz Bloodspilla
3550551	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550552	The Blood Ravens chapter had faced more than a few Ork assaults over its history, notably smashing the great horde on Tartarus. Perhaps because of this, the Orks under Warlord Gorgutz approached the assault on North Vandea with especial glee. Here was their chance to prove themselves stronger than their race’s greatest enemies.
3550553	Victory in North Vandea cost Gorgutz a huge number of his boyz, but the warlord was happy to pay the price. Gorgutz himself mounted two helmeted Space Marine skulls on his gruesome bosspole and his followers emulated him. Many Nobz and other larger Orks who survived the battle mounted Blood Raven helmets on their weapons or wore them on slings as war trophies. In the years to come, the battered red helms of the Blood Ravens would remain the most prized trophy among Gorgutz’ Orks.
3550554	For himself, the warlord celebrated his victory by taking on the name Gorgutz Bloodspilla.
3550560	Gorgutz Ragescreamer
3550561	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550562	Before his arrival on Kronus, Warlord Gorgutz had raided several other Tau colonies near the Damocles Gulf. This experience served him well as he sent waves of his boyz against the Tau defenders of Asharis. Bloody melees between Orks and Kroot showed the barbarity of both races and Gorgutz was happy to send waves of his Orks to die under Fire Warrior fusillades until he could overwhelm their lines.
3550563	In the end, however, the fall of Asharis was a frustration for Gorgutz. With the Tau forces retreating and taking the corpse of their Ethereal with them, the Ork Warlord was denied the gruesome trophies he loved so much. His frustration had not having Aun’el’s skull was epic in scope, and Gorgutz is said to have personally eviscerated the Orks who actually killed Aun’el, blaming them for not securing the Ethereal’s corpse.
3550564	This outburst of pique after a great victory won Gorgutz the name of Ragescreamer.
3550570	The Warlord of Kronus
3550571	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550572	With the last enemy beaten, Gorgutz’s horde reigned supreme on Kronus. The warlord himself had draped himself in the cruel glory of the Orks, being hailed at the Headhunter, the Ragescreamer, the Bloodspilla, the Deathkilla, the Daemonkilla, the Gunsmasha and the Ghostkilla.
3550573	The Orkish horde proceeded to pillage the planet to build their next invasion fleet. Gorgutz himself set off at the head of that fleet, but Kronus remained an Ork-infested world and the Warlord regularly returned there to gather forces for his next conquest.
3550574	With such a fertile base of operations, the Warlord would cut a swath through the Imperium’s eastern fringe and the Tau Empire for years to come.
3550600	Knowledge Is Power
3550601	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550602	The Space Marines of the Blood Ravens chapter arrived on Kronus like the mailed fist of the Emperor. Acting under orders from his Chapter Master and Chief Librarian, young Brother-Captain Davian Thule ordered the Blood Ravens to carry out a thorough purge of this world.
3550603	The Chapter Master had told Thule that ancient relics of the chapter were hidden on Kronus, artifacts from the mysterious early years of the Blood Raven. These sacred items could not be allowed to fall into alien hands.
3550604	Captain Thule ordered the withdrawal of the Imperial Guard forces stationed in Victory Bay, but Governor Alexander flatly refused to pull his men back. Thule judged the Governor a good man, but had little choice but to send his Space Marines to battle the Governor's troops along with all the other powers on Kronus.
3550605	The Blood Ravens willingness to fight soldiers of the Imperium did not go unnoticed. Whispers began that the relics on Kronus were more damning than holy. Only the war’s victors would be left to decide the truth of the matter.
3550610	Against the Black Apostle
3550611	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550612	The Blood Ravens assault on the black temples of the Deimos Peninsula replayed the tragic battles of the Horus Heresy. Once again, Space Marine fought Space Marine, one side holding true to the Emperor’s light, the other fallen into blackest heresy. The Blood Ravens faced this battle with zeal, anxious to bring down those who had betrayed all they stood for.
3550613	In the end, the Blood Ravens weathered the assault of daemons and traitors alike, closing the Warp gate that was feeding the heretical army and bringing down the fiendish Black Apostle who led it. As for the desecrated temples and foul shrines that dotted the landscape, the Librarians of the chapter catalogued and recorded all their contents. They then undertook the safe transport of these black artifacts to their Librarium, where they could be safely destroyed.
3550620	Relics of Biel-Tan
3550621	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550622	The Blood Ravens had suffered Eldar trickery on Tartarus and Rahe’s Paradise not long before their arrival on Kronus. In Tyrea, they avenged their fallen battle brothers with alien blood. By sealing the Eldar Farseer Taldeer’s webway portals, they blocked any possibility of her escape. What followed was a careful hunt for every last alien in Tyrea, culminating in the death of Taldeer herself.
3550623	The chapter’s Librarians, for their part, spent much of the aftermath of the battle studying the remains of the fearsome daemon summoned up by the Eldar. This so-called Avatar of Khaine – the savage incarnation of a blasphemous alien god – crumbled into inert matter at the battle’s apex.  Epistolary Anteas, senior Librarian on Kronus, made sure that each piece was collected, catalogued and shipped back to the chapter Librarium. In later years, this would cause the Blood Ravens no small amount of trouble.
3550630	The Rewards of Loyalty
3550631	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550632	When the Blood Ravens leveled the Governor-Militant's palace in Victory Bay, they brought an end to a sad conflict within the Imperium. Both Captain Thule and Governor Alexander were acting under orders of their superiors and neither could back down when those orders brought them into conflict. Captain Thule and Chaplain Mikelus went so far as to praise the slain Governor for his stalwart dedication to his orders. With his death, they arranged for the transport of the surviving Guardsmen off world. Most were sent toward Segmentum Command with testimonials that they had done their regiment proud.
3550633	The Blood Ravens were less forgiving to the rebellious Guardsmen of the 5th Company. Although these men had shouted their loyalty to the Emperor’s Angels of Death upon the death of Commissar Gebbet, the Space Marines showed them no favor. Indeed, these Guardsmen had taken up arms against their regiment and the Blood Ravens judged them traitors to be executed.
3550634	The Space Marines greatest ire, however, was reserved for the Techpriests who sabotaged the great Hellstorm cannon rather than have it fall into the chapter's hands. The one Enginseer who survived to be interrogated claimed he had done what he must to keep the cannon from unworthy hands.
3550640	Fall of the Warlord
3550641	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550642	As they had on Tartarus, the Blood Ravens cut with surgical precision into the heart of the Ork horde on Kronus. The hardened Space Marines sent into the depths of the Green Coast answered the green tide with waves of bolter fire and the faith of true soldiers of the Imperium. The swamps ran red with the blood of Orks, as camp after camp fell to the Blood Ravens’ purge.
3550643	That Warlord Gorgutz managed to escape Kronus weighed heavily on Captain Thule. He surmised (correctly as it turned out) that the Ork would someday return to plague the Imperium again. In an effort to make sure no other Orks survived, Thule ordered a massive scorched earth campaign, burning hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of jungle to purge the Ork once and for all.
3550650	Victory Over Death
3550651	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550652	The final assault against the Necrons in the catacombs under the Thur’Abis Plateau became the thing of legend among the Blood Ravens. Descending into that sepulchral underworld, the battle brothers must have felt cut off from the Emperor’s light altogether. Nevertheless, they fought with all the courage and steel of the Imperium’s finest, bringing holy fire to the enemies of all life.
3550653	Those brothers who emerged from that charnel underworld marked their armors with a small elongated skull, emblematic of their fallen Necron foes. The chapter’s second company, which contributed most of the forces sent into Thur’Abis, would add the Necron skull to its heraldry and adopt the motto “Victory Over Death.”
3550660	The Purge of Asharis
3550661	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550662	During the earlier Damocles Gulf Crusade, the Tau Empire had repelled the Novamarines who landed on Kronus. In their assault on Asharis, the Blood Ravens more than avenged the Novamarines’ defeat.
3550663	Much as the third company had during the Battle of Magna Bonum on Tartarus, the Blood Ravens fourth company fought its way through the streets of Asharis one block at a time, pushing back at the Tau Fire Warriors and Kroot carnivores with steely determination. The Tau Commander Kais did manage, however, to cheat the Blood Ravens of one prize, namely the body of the Ethereal Shi’ores, which would undoubtedly have ended up under study in the chapter Librarium and Apothecarion. As it was, Apothecary Gordion spent many days collecting the alien blood samples left behind when the Tau withdrew with the corpse of their slain Ethereal.
3550670	Dark Tidings
3550671	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550672	After many long and bloody battles, the Blood Ravens finally completed their purge of the Planet Kronus. The Battle Barge Litany of Fury remained in close orbit, imposing a strict prohibition on any visits to the world, while the fifth company maintained the Castellum Incorruptus in North Vandea.
3550673	The Imperial Guard’s Segmentum Command lodged protest for the Blood Ravens actions, reporting them to the Inquisition. The Blood Ravens successfully defended their actions, convincing their interrogators that General Alexander should have bowed to the Blood Ravens orders and withdrawn.
3550674	Nevertheless, the Inquisition kept a watchful eye on the chapter, for the rumors of hoarded relics never fully abated. Likewise, many in the Guard's command structure never forgot the blood shed on Kronus.
3550675	And indeed, the darkest time in the chapter’s history began soon after the war’s end.
3550700	For the Greater Good
3550701	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550702	The rise of the Necrons and the arrival of other powers on Kronus was a threat the Tau Empire could not ignore. With their doctrine built firmly around the so-called Greater Good, the Tau could not tolerate seeing a thriving colony taken away from them.
3550703	The Ethereals, leaders of the empire, responded to the distress signals from Kronus by sending some of their best and brightest to retake the world. Aun’el Shi’ores was among the most lauded of a new generation of the Ethereal caste; he would be responsible for restoring proper order to this wayward world. With him came the military leader Shas'o Kais. A student of the teachings of Commander Puretide, O’Kais brought a massive force of Fire Caste warriors as well as auxiliaries from the Tau’s allied races, the Kroot and Vespid.
3550704	Tau ground forces landed in the city of Tash’n (or Asharis to use its true Imperial name) and from there began the crusade to retake the planet as a whole.
3550710	The Taint of Chaos
3550711	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550712	The Tau forces who came to Kronus had not fought any major battles against the agents of Chaos and could not know the madness that awaited them. Nevertheless, O’Kais’s forces held strong, refusing to give into the daemons and heretics. The force pushed forward and finally disrupted the black enchantment that had brought the Chaos Space Marines to Kronus. Somewhat miraculously, not a single of the Tau soldiers fell into Warp heresy during the assault.
3550713	In the wake of this battle, however, the soldiers of the Fire Caste struggled to understand just what they had witnessed. Aun’el Shi’ores acted quickly to preserve his forces against the power of heresy. He ordered that all structures and ritual artifacts on the peninsula be leveled and the area sealed off under guard. Kroot carnivores who had partaken of the flesh of dead Chaos Space Marines and cultists were ruthlessly hunted down lest the taint make its way into their gene-matrix.
3550720	Secrets of the Craftworld
3550721	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550723	The Dark Crusade represented one of the first major clashes between the Tau Empire and Eldar forces. Both alien powers favored speed and stealth, and both employed a variety of inhuman technologies. Ultimately, the young surpassed the old and O’Kais’s forces overran the Eldar in Tyrea.
3550724	The Tau forces were very keen to learn the secrets of Eldar technologies. Negotiations for the release of Eldar prisoners could begin only after hostilities ended on Kronus. In the meantime, Water caste diplomats conducted extensive interviews with all Eldar prisoners. Earth caste scientists, meanwhile, dissected and analyzed the technologies of the Eldar. Although the Tau quickly analyzed Eldar laser and shuriken weapons, more esoteric weapons like the Warp-powered distort cannon and the nature of the wraithbone material used in so much Eldar construction proved much harder to crack.
3550730	Against the Imperium
3550731	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550732	Although other powers on Kronus threatened the Tau forces there with outright extermination, the Imperial Guard forces centered in Victory Bay threatened the legitimacy of the Tau claim to the world. Given the aliens’ unshakable faith in their own cause, this was in many ways the greater threat and O’Kais led his forces into Victory Bay as crusaders against heresy more than anything. This drive ultimately overcame the defenses set up by Governor-Militant Alexander's forces.
3550733	In the aftermath of the battle, the Tau rounded up the surviving Guardsmen and established a reeducation camp in an attempt to make them betray the God Emperor and embrace the Tau cause. Many resisted, most notably a Kasrkin squad which managed to escape into the countryside and launch a small guerilla campaign, but others succumbed and surrendered all they knew to the Tau. In the years to come, the forces of the Imperium would have reason to rue this last betrayal as Tau forces struck at weak points on several planets.
3550740	Ancient Technologies
3550741	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550742	O’Kais’s drive into the Necron catacombs relied heavily on the stealth and speed of his forces to deliver a fusion bomb to the heart of the deathless enemy’s power. His gambit succeeded, although he left many soldiers behind him.
3550743	In the wake of the battle, Aun’el Shi’ores directed the creation of a vast research complex on the Thur’Abis Plateau. Under the protection of Fire Warriors, the scientists of the Earth caste began the slow process of studying the technology used by the Necrons. The few pieces of Necron weaponry and smashed warriors that did not fade out of existence were subjected to very close scrutiny indeed. Whether or not the Tau Empire was ever able to make use of this ancient and loathsome technology is unknown, but their weaponry continues to advance, much to the chagrin of the Imperial forces facing them in combat.
3550750	Jungle War
3550751	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550752	The legendary Tau Commander Farsight had led troops on Kronus some decades before the Dark Crusade and had smashed the Ork horde of the Warboss Bonekraka. O’Kais studied Farsight’s tactics and used them in his assault on the Green Coast. By eliminating Warlord Gorgutz, he plunged the Ork horde into a cycle of infighting that effectively took them out of the battle for Kronus.
3550753	Still, Aun’el Shi’ores was hardly pleased that Kronus’s jungle remained infested with feral Orks. Even with other opponents still to fight, the Ethereal directed significant numbers of Fire Warriors and Kroot carnivores to hunt the remaining Orks, taking back one square kilometer of jungle at a time. The Kroot proved the most successful here, taking over much of the ecosystems of these areas in order to hunt down the Orks. Soon, the jungles of Kronus resembled the Kroot home world of Pech more than anything.
3550760	Relics of the Enemy
3550761	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550762	Tau forces and Space Marines had clashed on Kronus during the Damocles Gulf crusade, but these had been small hit and run engagements. The Tau assault on North Vandea was something else altogether, with O’Kais leading his troops in an assault on the entrenched and well-defended Blood Ravens. Warriors of the Emperor, the Space Marines left many Tau and Kroot dead, but were unable to hold back O’Kais’s tide. When the Blood Ravens left Kronus, many of their finest soldiers lay dead in North Vandea.
3550763	In the Blood Ravens, Aun’el Shi’ores saw what he considered the worst of the Imperium of Man. The Ethereal called their faith madness and their purge of Kronus murder on a global scale. He chose thus to preserve the remains of the Space Marine fortress in North Vandea as an example of the opposition the Greater Good faced in the wider galaxy.
3550770	The Third Sphere Grows
3550771	From “Dark Crusade: A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3550772	With the last enemy stronghold broken, the Tau hold on Kronus became secure once again. The task force sent from the Tau home world remained on the planet to secure it, and soon thereafter further waves of settlers and colonists arrived from across the empire. The humans left on Kronus found life increasingly difficult for them – many had embraced the Imperial return and now found themselves subject to reeducation or other penalties.
3550773	Intensive colonization by Tau and Kroot led to a rapid demographic swing, with the human population dwindling to less than 5% a decade after the Dark Crusade. Although no public announcements were ever made to this effect, it seems clear that human births on Kronus also dropped precipitously. In part this is due to the single-gender reeducation camps imposed by the Tau, but it is also possible that the alien powers undertook some form of sterilization project – all for the so-called Greater Good.
3550774	Whatever the truth, when Kronus was admitted as a full sept of the so-called Third Sphere, its human population was but a footnote.

3603102	It was during the Horus Heresy that Chaos first drove marine against marine. Kronus witnessed some of this terrible fighting and the heretics of those ancient times left behind them terrible artifacts.
3603103	In the desolate Eres Badlands stood one such talisman, an ancient icon of the Blood God Khorne. With war sweeping Kronus once more, a daemon within the icon awoke. It fed on the souls of those slain in combat and promised gifts to whoever would slake its thirst for blood.

3651000	The Planet Kronus.
3651001	Beset on all sides by the tides of war, this once-quiet colony became a savage battlefield.
3651002	Seven armies clashed on this one world, each refusing to back down, each convinced it was in the right.
3651003	From beneath the sands of Kronus’s central desert came the Necrons, ancient machines bent on eradicating all life.
3651004	But another evil already had its eyes on the planet. From the depths of the Warp, the daemonic forces of Chaos arrived to enforce their claim.
3651005	To oppose these fearsome powers, the planet’s rulers in the Tau Empire sent their elite soldiers and sophisticated battlesuits into the fray.
3651006	From the mighty Imperium of Man came the Imperial Guard, there to secure Kronus for the glory of the God Emperor.
3651007	Like a green tide, the Ork horde descended on Kronus, caring little for others’ claims and sowing destruction in its wake.
3651008	The Eldar, ancient enemies of the Necrons, emerged from their Webway to pursue their own agenda on Kronus.
3651009	And last came the Space Marines, finest and most uncompromising of the Imperium’s soldiers. Seeing a world beset by aliens and heretics, they undertook a great purge.
3651010	A Dark Crusade had begun. It could only end with the total victory of one of these factions, and the total defeat of all others.

3700051	From “A Relation of the Second Kronus War” by Scriba Marcus Orestes:
3700052	Although the local workers never realized it, the mines of Kronus's Hyperion Peaks featured powerful ore refining machines left there by the Tech-Priests of Mars. These ancient ore-processing and field-manufacturing plants took on a more martial aspect during the Dark Crusade.
3700053	Indeed, these same devices could, with relative ease, be made to produce military structures or the processed materials needed to assemble them in the field. Those in control of this facility thus gained the ability to rapidly build forward bases as they pushed across Kronus.
3700054	The Peaks were a difficult battlefield, however, isolated from standard supply lines. Those trying to take the mines were forced to send in a single armored column ordered to wipe out all enemy structures. Without reinforcements, the tank commanders were on their own.

3900082	Adrift in the barren northern lands of Sama stands a single metropolis, which has now become a Preceptory of the Sisters of Battle, Order of the Emperor's Virgins. Most likely the Sisters chose this city for its symbolism: a proud testament to the Imperium rising out of a dusty wasteland.
3900083	Prior to the arrival of the Sisters of Battle, the Sama District was one of the regions least dependant on the Imperial Guard presence. Wild game hunting, active East-West trade, and domestic manufacture had supported an independent population that welcomed the Sisters of Battle with nearly as much reverence as fear.

3900087	++ Public Declaration ++
3900088	Faithful servants of the Emperor and citizens of Sama, this provincial realm is hereby claimed and annexed unto the right and pious cause of the Sisters of Battle, acting as a hand of the One True Ecclesiarchy. Be assured that all property, sustenance, and chattel you are compelled to donate to our holy cause will be repaid by the Emperor’s love, now and hereafter.
3900089	Be advised that no one who is righteous and holds his allegiance to the God-Emperor need be alarmed. Only the corrupt, the mutant, and the heretic shall perish in flames. Any wishing to confess themselves up front, and pass swiftly into blessed redemption should report to the new Preceptory headquarters, in Moksha Square, at 1000 hours, sharp. Devout individuals wishing to join the Frateris Militia should report at 0950 hours.
3900090	++ End ++
3900091	This eastern edge of Kaurava I’s leviathan city has recently begun to experience annexation by the Sisters of Battle. Although no outright conflict has yet taken place, its northern sectors have been quietly claimed by the Sisterhood.
3900092	Conflict between the Sisters of Battle and the Imperial Guard has occurred of late in this area of the city. As a result, the populace of the cities and suburbs of the province have largely fled, seeking refuge in neighboring provinces.
3900093	++ Memorandum ++
3900094	++ Topic: A New Vision for Imperial Kaurava ++
3900095	++ Subsection: Vyasastan ++
3900096	++ Sender: Governor-General Vance Stubbs ++
3900097	Key among the precepts I require enacted is that  administratum and military forums find mutual expression. I will repeat this as many times as necessary to get the point across. This must happen, we cannot have divisions in purpose, although we must be divided in function.
3900098	To this end the aqueducts in sectors 19, 37, and 4 will be expanded to accommodate better converse between Dussala and Vyasa. I have already ordered the embankments on the Virata River fortified. 
3900099	Furthermore, the outer urban areas will be properly districted, just as on Attila, and the foundation-work laid for an additional space-port, with full shipping and military capacities. By these and other such efforts, we will make our world redound to the glory of the God-Emperor.
3900100	Dussala forms the southern stretch of the great leviathan city of Kaurava I. It is also the central headquarters of the Imperial Guard presence of the system, proud home of the 252nd Conservator Regiment. 
3900101	Throughout Dussala, military and civilian life have blended remarkably well. There are few Dussalan families without at least one son enlisted in the 252nd. 
3900102	++ Dussala Daily Eclipse ++
3900103	++ Morning Edition, second frame ++
3900104	Attention Dussalans:
3900105	As per the orders of Governer-General Stubbs’ sub-auxilliary executive commissioner of planetary affairs, we are pleased to announce… that tomorrow at 1100 hours there will be a formal parade of 252nd Conservator troops and heavy armor, before they are deployed to the field of battle. Attendance is mandatory. Daily Eclipse editorial looks forward to seeing you all there. Among the parade retinue will be 10,000 Guardsmen, two refitted Baneblades, and a newly arrived company of Kasrkin Guard, direct from the frontlines on Cadia.
3900106	You will come and wish our troops well. Twelve processional troops will play anthems of the Imperium, and Valkyries will perform flying maneuvers overhead. We have been asked to remind you to heed all Adeptus Arbites direction immediately, as they are authorized to respond with force of arms.
3900107	At the heart of Kaurava I is Kaurav City. This region is one vast city, which is, in fact, part of an even more gigantic city extending through Dussala and Vyasastan. But it is Kaurav City that is the pinnacle of Imperial culture in the system, its capital, and home to the great universities, libraries, and Ecclesiarchal temples.
3900108	The city itself is a patchwork of new growth and decaying neglect. Fresh structures are raised amongst collapsed, burnt out, and decaying buildings. Slums flank mansions and opulent centers of commerce.

3900112	++ Objectives ++
3900113	Purge of all city sectors where the morally depraved, corrupt, unseemly, and poor have increased in number. Performed annually in coordination with Imperial Guard Hellhounds and the Adeptus Arbites. 
3900114	++ Report ++
3900115	In this purge, 1,700 potential heretics and mutants were identified – all were cleansed and burnt upon the Inquisitorial stakes. At a date not later than 100 years from the current time, our Lord Seroglazni will reattend to ensure correct cleansing is being adhered to. 
3900116	++Conclusion++
3900117	Annual purge remains a vital organ in the functioning corpus of Kaurava I’s effective governance.
3900118	The small province formed by the habitable shore of Shakun Sea is famous for its health benefits, and for the wealthy and powerful who tend to have second homes along the water.
3900119	The region boasts several proper cities, along with numerous poor fishing villages. A famed museum of xenos and mutant curiosities was closed with the arrival of Governor Stubbs, who deemed it blasphemous and heretical.

3900122	Miron,
3900123	I can’t tell you much at the present, things have been in such disarray. Also, I can’t trust that this letter won’t be read. The important thing is, expect me in a week. By Holy Terra, Miron, no good will come to anyone left in Vyasastan. I’m just a petty cleric, not some battle hardened Guardsman. I’m not made for this.
3900124	Things here are bad. Officially nobody has made a move, but there’s shelling and Lightning fighter runs overhead, and every day some building gets stormed, by which I mean flamed with multi-meltas. Ordo Hereticus business. Now I’m behind the 252nd all the way, what with Uncle Jurr a Major and all that, but at the end of the day my allegiance is to the Immortal God-Emperor and the Ecclesiarchy.
3900125	You see what a scrape I’m in? What, with my ties to the planetary requisitions and commerce commissions? I can’t stay – no one can stay – or they’ll come under suspicion from one side or another. That is all I can say here. The important thing is, expect me within the week. I’ll be there.
3900126	Ciron
3900127	Home to the only Ancient Gate on Kaurava I, a part of Jalaganda is effectively an extension of Kaurav City. Here, bustling interplanetary commerce passes constantly through the gate, making many merchants fabulously rich.
3900128	There is another Jalaganda, however. The humid land of silty rivers, canals, and mud-hut villages is peopled by the solitary “Lowlanders,” brave, taciturn people. It is said they make excellent, dependable Guardsmen.

3900132	Well I got back and right off I knew it wasn’t right no more. It was my 17th tour, and they said I could have off. Heavy weapons, been to II and IV. 
3900133	See I wasn’t thinking. A few drinks and there I was gabbing about mountains full of Orks, where we Lowlanders, most’ve us ain’t never seen mountains, let alone Orks. Then, see, well, on my last tour, we came across the foul abominations of Chaos. Man, you wouldn’t believe what I saw, but the worst of it was, just before we cut out of there, I swear, I swear or give me a muddy grave, I saw Sureb, and he was with them. Sureb, what as grew up down the way from me, Lowlander right enough, eight brothers all told. Gone over to the other side!
3900134	Well, I shoulda known never to open my big mouth about that. Didn’t sit right. Strange tales, speakin’ ill of your neighbors. No, I can’t stay. I’m a Lowlander no more. So, see, Commissar, I’d like to go back. All I am now is a Guardsman. I got to face that.
3900135	The northern continent of Kaurava II is a harsh, forbidding land, noted for its striking and singular beauty. The region was given its solitary name because no one but hermits and nomads could survive there long. These nomads sustain themselves by hunting the prized and dangerous game found in the northernmost reaches of Solitude.
3900136	When the Blood Ravens arrived, they claimed a relatively habitable basin near the center of the region. As Space Marines they found Solitude’s harshness nothing to the accustomed rigors of war.
3900137	++ Reconnaissance Report ++
3900138	++ Scout Captain Kensey, Adeptus Astartes, Blood Ravens Chapter ++
3900139	Reconnaissance team responsible for the survey of northwestern quadrant of the territory, an area of several thousand square kilometers. Report is as follows. 
3900140	75km radius due W to due N around proposed headquarters: There is no flat terrain and no good foot or vehicular paths. Assault from this northerly direction would be extremely difficult.
3900141	120km WNW: Viable water source. Thunderhawk convoys will be necessary.
3900142	512km due N: Gentle valley, potential landing area for enemy assault. Scant evidence of prior settlement there. Detonated several cliff-sides, closing the valley and rendering it inhospitable.
3900143	970km NNW: Interesting encounter. Several great horned beasts, massive forearms, climbing among steep embankments. Scouting team readied to fire, but human nomads garbed in gray and white camouflage came from nowhere, killing the beasts with great speed and efficiency. Note to command: investigate recruiting these nomads. If unsuitable as Neophytes for our Chapter, refer for Imperial Guard recruitment.
3900144	These idyllic and fertile lands have drawn generation after generation of human settlers. Farms burgeon and coastal fisheries yield plentiful catch, providing much of the system with food. The warm seasons are long, and the winter is temperate. 
3900145	All would indeed be tranquil in the province, were it not for occasional Ork sorties out of the adjoining Rokclaw range. The base of these mountains had been dotted with Imperial Guard outposts, many of which have recently been abandoned or destroyed.
3900146	++ Overheard at the Emperor’s Ascension hab bar, Kaurav City ++
3900147	Buy me another drink and I’ll tell you the whole story. Ah! A good man, knows the value of a drink. Well I was farming, Western Cerulea. That’s right, land of beauty. Land of bounty. Well, where I was, we get some Orks now and then. Haha! Why yes, I’ve seen an Ork. More than one, since I was a pup. You act surprised, but this is life on Two. 
3900148	But I’ll tell you, I never seen Orks in numbers like this. So the farm got a single permacrete tower, and all us farmers are up in it. The rusty – I mean trusty (har har!) 252nd show up, and they hold ‘em off for awhile. Only then, twice the number of Greens was there. I knew it was getting bad when they swarmed a Leman Russ and wrenched the hatch off. Honest to goodness, and I swear to you as I sit here now, I thought we were all goners that day.
3900149	Just then I hear this rumbling, and I look back, and coming right in from north – right over all our new-sowed crops! – is a row of maybe a dozen or so dull red tanks. Blood Ravens! I am telling you the Emperor’s truth. First thing they blast is that Leman Russ. Next thing I know, Space Marines are pouring out of their Rhinos and giving those Orks such a meal of bolter rounds as to lay ‘em flat. 
3900150	After that… well, after that I realized the value a’ life, and I thought, Kaurava I, more Guardsmen and no Orks. Conservators, that’s the place for me.
3900151	Gently rolling woodlands cover almost the entirety of Trivie. As peaceful and lovely as neighboring Cerulea, the many Trivian forests bear fruit and lumber. The human inhabitants have suffered more greatly from Ork attacks than the rest of the northern hemisphere. 
3900152	Great human cities had once thrived in the north of Trivie, but as the Imperial Guard’s grasp on the system weakened, Orks overran their mountains and the human population mostly fled or scattered.

3900172	Hundreds of islands, some small enough for a single village, lie as if they had tumbled off the mainland. The crystalline waters are rarely deep, and fish school in great numbers. Until the current war, generations of humble villages dotted the islands.
3900173	The only part of the entire region that is not rustic is the lander pad that allows traffic with Irridene, one of the planet’s two moons.

3900176	So what I see’d was… well, see, we get out in the boats a ways before sunlight. Bearfish feed then. So we’re on the water like, and I’m there above board with the nets in my hands, gettin’ them ready. 
3900177	I jus’ looked up. Fine clear night. Irridene’s high up, a-glitterin’, and Orridune’s down low. Paint a picture, ya could. That’s when I see’d it. A streak, not like a ship comin’ outta warp travel, no. Just outta th’ distance. An’ it slowed – an’ got bigger – and like as if just met up with the moon. Went right into it. 
3900178	By now I done dropped the net, standin’ there like a Sirrabin Shark. I squinted and it hadn’t hit Orridune, it just stopped right at it like. An’ a squinted a hair more and saw it wasn’t one thing, it was dozens a’ little specks, just resting there, above the moon.
3900179	Well, sirs, I fear th’ ‘cclesiarchy right proper as the next man. Watch it, I thought, then say what ye’ve seen. So the next night, moon came up, and the specks were still there. But now I’d a swored you could see some-aught crawling upon Orridune. I’d a swore. So I came right next day, and here I be.
3900180	There are few places in Kaurava II where you cannot see the vast, imposing peaks of the Rokclaw Mountains looming in the distance. Those peaks, though majestic, have always inspired as much dread as awe. Orks have lurked there since the first Imperial Valkyries arrived.
3900181	Now Warboss Gorgutz has raised a huge Waaagh! and the mountain paths teem with Orks and bristle with banners and turrets. Smoke from Ork foundries billows into the clear blue skies, and the bellows of training Squiggoths echo in the valleys.

3900210	With the Ork Waaagh! underway and the outer Imperial Guard establishment crumbing, Monse has not been able to hold off attacks, and stretches of the once pristine territory now lie in ruins.

3900214	To better protect all residents of our city, a strict curfew of sundown will be enforced. Official passes will be issued to the small number of individuals who need to be out after curfew starts. 
3900215	Finally, it has come to our attention that a malicious rumor has sprung up concerning xenos on the moon Orridune. We have confirmation from our local Imperial Guard Commissar that no alien has landed, or COULD land on the moon. All rumors concerning a “death-ray” stationed on that moon, alien or otherwise, are also false. Rumor mongers will be handed to the commissariat for mind scrubbing.

3900218	The rough-hewn and picturesque hill country west of the Rokclaws has belonged to the Orks as often as they have belonged to the Imperium. As a result, the land has never supported greater settlement than small villages and cattle pasturing. Many past centuries of strife have seen Orks and humans existing in bloody and uneasy proximity. 
3900219	Beneath the almost constant low-lying fog, many miles of this province show the signs of hasty and careless strip-mining. Other areas suffer the chemical wounds of industry and warfare, resulting in miles of barren slopes.

3900242	Emerald green and half-shrouded in silver mists, it is not hard to see why those who first discovered the islands chose the name they did. The choice proved to be fitting. For nearly a millennium a quiet people have dwelled there, not leaving and not welcoming strangers.
3900243	Although they had never declared a separation from the Imperium or any other heresy, the people of the Forgotten Isles lived apart. Of course, such isolation could never survive the current war.
3900244	++ Mreet Kettlorn, Kauravan Historian ++
3900245	++ Fifteen Cycles in Paradise: A Historical Travelog of Kaurava II, pp. 1341 – 42 ++
3900246	During my three cycles upon the Forgotten Isles, I learned much; foremost, I learned that there was much these secretive folk would never reveal to me. But I will give, as much as is in my power, a broad sketch of its provenance.
3900247	The discoverer and also namer of the Forgotten Isles was Tur Turgold, the fifteenth of Kaurava’s First Settlers, and the one about whom we know the very least. A statue of him stands in the town square on the largest island, Tilk, although it was more than a cycle before anyone would confirm the fact.
3900248	Some say that Tur was in fact a mute, others that, in the strange mode of expression these islanders have, he “loved words not.” It is clear enough that the Forgotten Islanders view their isolation, terse speech, and general secrecy as something they inherit from Tur himself. 
3900249	I must take a moment to dispel some of the rumors concerning these isles. Whatever the cause of their nature, they are not, I assure the good reader, heretics. They fear and love the Emperor, as all men must. They are not cannibals or wizards, nor mutants. They are simply quiet folks, although the historical causes of this shift are of considerable interest…
3900250	Up until the appearance of the Warp Storm, the barren second moon then known as Orridune had been more or less ignored. If the Imperial Guard presence on the planet below had not been crumbling, or if the Orks were star-gazers by nature, they would have noticed a miraculous occurrence.
3900251	They would have seen a Tau fleet descend on the moon, deploying thousands of drones. With surprising speed and effort, the Earth Caste created localized atmosphere, water supplies and a great plateau. The fleet then landed, and the construction of the Nan Yanoi military complex was begun.
3900252	++ Nan Yanoi ++
3900253	++ Construction Report E1.998.052 ++
3900254	Orange sector ahead of schedule. Subsectors 1-9 to 12-9 are functionally complete.
3900255	Blue sector has had some issues with the slag deposit hook-up. Several of our best Earth Caste have been sent to look into the problem. We anticipate only minor delays. A strange report from 7-2-Blue: Somehow a builder drone had been misprogrammed, and was found constructing the entire schematic for Nan Yanoi in rivets on a ventilation casing plate.
3900256	Red sector is a cause for concern. Moderate to great delays may be possible here. This is due in part to structural inadequacies in the moon’s surface beneath our terraforming efforts. There was also a minor… incident between a particularly noisy Kroot regiment and dormant Vespids.
3900257	Thirty-two construction drones are damaged and require repairs. Nineteen of these are due to a power surge in a conduit they were working on, the others require normal regular maintenance.
3900258	If it weren’t for the Ancient Gate, this icy moon would have gone on as ignored as its sister. The Ancient Gate, in times of peace, had provided a vital route for interplanetary trade and a valuable tool to the Imperial Guard. To facilitate its usefulness, lander pads had been built in two planetside territories, allowing regular traffic to and from the moon. Linking these pads to the Gate is a small industrial city, complete with factory beds, depots, and a commercial space port.

3900264	Strong winds howl between the mesas and other barren rock formations that cover the northern reaches of the planet. The territory is truly barren, offering nothing required to sustain life other than sunlight and heat.
3900265	In earlier times, only a few Imperial mining outposts graced the rocky landscape. When the Eldar arrived, these quickly vanished, replaced by a shimmering, delicate network of infiltrated military installations – an army moving among the shadows.
3900266	++ Speech on the Meaning of Duty and Glory ++
3900267	++ Farseer Caerys of Biel-Tan, on arriving in Essir Il-Tanil ++
3900268	We have made battle in this place before. We have fought and won. Fought because we knew that we must. We won, and brought upon ourselves glory that will not fade as long as Biel-Tan thrives. Now we are called to battle again. Must we perform a duty which we have already accomplished? If we fight and fail, are our former victories tarnished?
3900269	We are like echoes in a cave, or waves upon the water: performing our part every time we are called. We who have glimpsed into the flow of time see that it is exactly such vast confluence, paths crossed and re-crossed. All are swept along. And we Eldar, masters of hindsight, insight, and foresight are bound that much more tightly to our duty than the ignorant, the belligerent, the blind. 
3900270	When one truly understands fate as it is, myriad branching paths, then one can truly see that duty is cleaving to a particular fate, and glory is the accomplishment of duty’s ends. When we are true to the nature of the Eldar, we cannot fail.
3900271	Once the broken lands were home to the largest and most developed Imperial population on the planet. Large cities were flanked by stately suburbs, industry supported by vast mining and production facilities. 
3900272	Unfortunately, a commercial enterprise to bring mining to the Kaurava III’s moon resulted in a massive explosion. Half the moon was turned to dust and ice, now rings encircling the planet. The rest scourged the face of the broken lands, resulting in untold death and destruction.
3900273	++ Personal Journal of Game Hunter Jan Solenz ++
3900274	Provisions, ammo, and power cells for thirty cycles loaded into my speeder. If I can bag at least three Horned Nigos and an Arkenbeast or two, I can spend half a year wasted on a Cerulean beach…
3900275	Spotted small family of Nigos this morning. Trailed them whole day. Ambushed them at sunset and got one. Had to hightail it to escape the others, but managed to lose them and get back before anything got at the corpse.
3900276	Saw green flashes, like lightning, on horizon to the SW. 
3900277	Trailing an Arkenbeast for two cycles. Can’t get too close. Just need to wait until I can get a clear shot.
3900278	Think I’m losing my mind out here. Saw more green flashes. Headed towards them on my speeder, and if I didn’t know better, I’d think I saw a sort of black pyramid way out, and a great green aura all around it. Top of it flashed green. Got the hell out of there.
3900279	Almost got a shot on the Arkenbeast. Had my rifle set, ready to pull the trigger. Suddenly saw something out of the corner of my eye. Thin things, like humans, running. Gleamed white. Then they walked up to an empty space, and a sort of arch was there, and a flash, and they were gone. That’s it. They’re right, you do go mad if you stay out here too long. I’m bagging this one ‘Beast and going home. 
3900280	Fetid lakes punctuate squalid stretches of dull, clayish prairie. Sluggish rivers trickle water from higher elevations to lower, and once per cycle cold and bitter rains pummel the greater part of these lands for weeks together.
3900281	No more than a few squalid villages dot Kier Harrad, although they grow larger and less desperate near the border of Nirraein.

3900283	Dear Anneke,
3900284	You wouldn’t believe the rain here. I’m hating every moment of it. It’s not like the rain we get in Dussala. It’s cold and dark and stings, and the rain doesn’t go into the soil. Things don’t grow here. Not many things, anyway. 
3900285	Hell, when I joined up with the 252nd, I thought I’d be stationed on Two, shooting Orks with heavy weapons from some bunker. I mean, I thought I’d get to fight for the Imperium. I want to fight the enemy, not sit around! We’re camped here in Kier Harrad, and we just wait. We stand guard, we go in patrols, but we just wait.
3900286	Sure, there are rumors. Maybe you’ve heard them all the way back in Dussala. Something came out of the sands in the south, in Imossa. Some people say it’s some type of Arkenbeast swarm or sandworms, and they crush entire villages flat. Well if any of that’s true, I haven’t seen it. Strange stuff going on up North, too. Some mining operations up in the Wastes just gone. Lost radio contact, and gone. Most likely I’ll just sit here in this humid bunker with the cold and the sound of rain, and die of boredom before I get to die for the Emperor. Wait for me, Anneke. In this world or the next, wait for me.

3900289	The rough country of Principia is not so barren, dry, or formidable as to bar life entirely. Anything that dwells there, whether human or one of the species of large and dangerous beast that roam the planet, must accommodate itself to a remarkably harsh and unforgiving landscape and climate.
3900290	The scattered remnants at several early Imperial attempts at cities can be seen upon the Badlands’ heights. For centuries, no more than game hunters and a few well-defended Imperial Guard posts have subsisted here.
3900291	I, Ranger Captain Inessar of Biel-Tan, deliver my report concerning the territory known as Orreloth, or Principia to the younger races. All that I speak is as I and my Rangers have seen.
3900292	Gone are the three great Orrel spires, toppled and broken and ground to dust. No sign of them remains. Ruins of the Imperium lie where two of the spires stood. The third is bare. Gone are fully half of the hidden Webway gates which our ancestors placed, and many of those remaining need repair. Strange beasts now roam the land, and no Eldar should roam this country unarmed or alone. 
3900293	The Imperium is not strong here. Human hunters go alone, or in threes. They pose no threat. Five military outposts watch the byways and broad places. These we can remove or ignore. They will not see us, if we do not choose it. The Farseer will guide us in this and all matters.  
3900294	In all other ways, Orreloth is as we left it – gnarled and difficult. Hard to fight in and hard to hold.
3900295	At the far western edge of Principia lie stretches of land so jagged, uneven, and dangerous that it is almost impossible to traverse them on foot. Beyond these so-called “rocklands” lies the Cape of Despair. 
3900296	 
3900297	Warlock Birliel spoke.
3900298	“To the eye, we stand upon the edge of a great abyss, in a land of austere beauty but little life. To the heart, which remembers, we stand in the very place where great acts and great losses were known to the Eldar, in an age before this one.
3900299	“Do you know it? Your heart does, I assure you. Hear my words and judge for yourself. When we battled the Necrons so very long ago, the Essence of the Deceiver was summoned against us. It made us believe this cliff to be an endless plane, and our foes to be weak and defenseless. There was one Eldar alone who broke free of the madness and saw our certain doom. He was a mighty Aspect Warrior, and in that time he was made a great Avatar of Khaine. He led us from death and certain doom, and on to a great victory in that war. For this the Deceiver later slew him, but the Necrons' loss could not be altered. It was a turning point, and the war swiftly turned in our favor.”
3900300	The Warlock was silent a moment. “It is for this that we must remember. Clarity and foresight ever keep us from the brink of destruction.”
3900301	Life does not, as a rule, thrive on Kaurava III – but it fares better in Nirraein than anywhere else. The four cities of Immur, Throne, Karrusk, and Timmolin subsist off of the Ancient Gate that they encircle, carrying trade to and from the other planets in the system.
3900302	The wealth in Nirraein has allowed for a modest amount of terraforming, hydroponics, and security from outland beasts. The region has also been home to the famed Kauravan gladiatorial arenas and speed-racing courses.

3900304	++ Colonel’s Memorandum #13-9935 ++
3900305	All guards, sentries, and other soldiers on active duty will maintain extra vigilance within 15km of the Ancient Gate. We have received several strange reports of attacks coming from the very gate itself. As the nature of these attacks is unknown, be ready for anything, fellow Guardsmen.
3900306	++ Colonel’s Memorandum #13-9936 ++
3900307	As of this morning, we are officially escalating to battle-readiness within the vicinity of the Ancient Gate. Since yesterday’s memorandum, multiple eye-witness reports have confirmed the nature of these attacks. The assailants fly in dark, angular ships. High output gun-posts are being erected around the ancient gate in order to preserve our perimeter.
3900308	++ Colonel’s Memorandum #13-9937 ++
3900309	Overnight, six of the eleven gun-posts guarding the ancient gate were destroyed, without even a call for help. Whatever we are dealing with here is extremely dangerous and very likely extremely fast. A request for help has been sent to Dussala. Let us pray to the Emperor that help arrives in time.
3900310	The high northern regions of Kaurava III’s single continent lower gradually into vast tracts of red desert. The desert itself eventually descends into the poisonous and uninhabitable abyss that shrouds over two thirds of the planet.
3900311	The Imperial forces that have long controlled the system never suspected that something terrible might lie beneath those sands. Not even when the first awakened Necrons crawled from the sands did they learn the truth. By the time they did, crossing into Imossa meant only one thing: death.

3900320	VERST: It says 108.
3900321	PIRENUS: Yeah, and the indicators… that just can’t be. It’s all sand. We KNOW it’s all sand. Sand all the way down to bedrock, and nothing else. 
3900322	VERST: Now it’s 96.
3900323	PIRENUS: What? It’s MOVING? That’s the same reading? Are you sure. Verst, what the hell does it mean if it’s moving? No, you know what? On second thought, I don’t want to know. Let’s clear on to the next sector. We’ll make up the numbers.
3900324	VERST: Pi, the vox recorder’s still going.
3900325	PIRENUS: Emperor’s feet! Well don’t forget to destroy that bit when we get back, and we’ll fake the numbers. My god, the sands – they’re moving! For Terra’s sake, GO!
3900326	While the great mountain range crosses the entire upper continent of Kaurava IV, top to bottom, it is the northeast province that is true mountain country, taking the name of those predominant mountains. 
3900327	Before the arrival of Chaos on the planet, the Morholts were verdant and grandiose, looking down on the fertile lands on either side. Now they have blackened and grown sinister. Foul things lurk in the crevices and caves of this country, while the Word Bearers Legion or the Dark Eldar fight for and travel through the high-placed Ancient Gate there.

3900330	What the thick-headed fools with their broken corpse of an Emperor fail to understand is that not only can they never defeat us, but they can not hide or flee or shield themselves from the triumph of Chaos. 
3900331	They are finite and we are unbound, undivided. They must not err, or they fall to heresy. All who fall join our cause. Every Imperial fool who dares to open his eyes is a willing recruit. They strive merely to hold back our fury and might, and it consumes them. 
3900332	Thus you can see Chaos is inevitable. We lurk not only beyond their grasp and at their gates; we lurk within the darkness of their souls, on the tip of their tongues, in their tortured dreams. We are them, but freed from the shackles of ignorance. We are them, grown strong… evolved . We are them, but so much more!
3900333	Once a beautiful patchwork of city and rolling farmland, this rough-hewn peninsula is now mired in the darkness of Chaos. The ground festers and crawls and trees are overgrown with sinister-looking vines and strange fungal growths. Black things swoop through the air, often in great numbers, blotting out sunlight and making a great, distant noise.
3900334	The Warp Storm steadily whirls above the planet. Raw energy seems to funnel down and touch the peninsula at a single point. That point seems remarkably close to the Word Bearers’ headquarters.

3900345	The lower stretches of the Morholt Mountains are full of vertiginous peaks, with waterfalls cascading thousands of meters to emerald pools below. Much of this province is so pitched and uneven that it is not habitable or passable by humans. Only one pathway offers land-passage between the northeast and the southwest, and that is known as Gurmun’s Pass.
3900346	This pass is at places a wide and pleasant valley, dotted with quiet villages. In other places, it narrows to little more than one tank’s breadth. 
3900347	++ Excerpt: Word Bearers Legion reconnaissance report ++
3900348	It was the fourth cycle since we had set out into the mountains. Much of the passage was jagged, and by nightfall we had reached a place so narrow and steep that we could see little other than the night sky, the stars cowering before the beautifully savage and luminous Warp Storm. Finally, in the minutes before dawn, we reached a high place and the path widened. We saw below us a gentle valley, a sleepy village nestled against a stream there. We descended, and after spilling the blood of the sleeping innocents, we set a sacrificial fire in Khorne’s name and razed the settlement to the ground! 
3900349	The fifth cycle was provident, as we were able to surprise an Imperial Guard outpost and destroy it utterly. We offered many up as sacrifices in the name of the Chaos gods, and took what food and munitions were of use to us.
3900350	The majority of the land on the planet’s equator lies in this province. The general lack of warmth on this fourth and farthest planet from Kaurava’s sun makes the Tristram Plains the best farmland by far. 
3900351	While the northern reaches of the Plains were quickly overrun by Chaos, producing mutated beasts of simple cattle, the southernmost reaches retain their rustic beauty, and until the Dark Eldar arrived, many farmers lived on as if there were no war raging around them. Of course, they are now all slaves caged upon the moon of Lacunae.

3900355	The following is a direct account reported by a farmer who fled from Tristram on Kaurava IV. He fled to Jalaganda via the Ancient Gate directly after witnessing these events. The farmer, one Stifan Nirebolus, has since been fully confessed and received a merciful death.
3900356	"I swear this is true, Sister, as I fear the Emperor. When the Chaos Space Marines attacked our farmstead I hid in the heath behind. I had hidden a small and very quiet auto bike there. I knew I should flee, but I couldn’t stop myself – I saw them burning the servants’ quarters and the silo. I saw them drag my brother’s family out of their house kicking and screaming. I should have gone, it was so terrible. Then, suddenly, there was a screaming sound and what looked like black locusts clouding the sky. The Dark Eldar! I have only heard of them, but there was no mistaking what I saw. Before I knew it, they were firing on the Word Bearers Legion… I saw one of the Chaos Space Marines tear the arm off of one. I also beheld a terrible woman in a loincloth fight three Marines at once, cutting off each of their heads in turn. A stray beam burnt the tree beside me to a crisp, and I fled."
3900357	Isolated from much of the upper continent by the Morholt Range, Marconia has always had more in common with the technology-based customs and ways of the Parmenians, south across the Lowering Straight.
3900358	Prior to the Warp Storm, the regional capital, comprised of dozens of aggregated cities, were centers of learning, art, and industry. 
3900359	Archon! I, Kel Urect, Sybarite, return with news of victory and increase. With a force of one hundred and twelve we stormed Marconia. Before our might and speed, city after city fell. Surprised, humans fell to their knees and begged for mercy, and we showed them none. Fillion fell, and Sabreguard, and Bierhold was leveled to the ground. We slayed many, but for every kill, ten were taken alive, so that the gifts we bring, proffered to the might of the Black Heart Kabal, are more than numerous. We serve you, Archon, for you are mighty. I, Kel Urect, Sybarite, have spoken, and you may judge my words by my deeds.
3900360	Not long ago, the first Imperial colonists, devotees of the Imperial Machine Cult found their way to this southern continent of Kaurava IV and settled there. Since that time, Parmenie has been the primary source of Techpriests and boasts factories of an order fit to fully supply the 251st, 252nd and 253rd Imperial Guard Regiments with tanks and weaponry.
3900361	When the Dark Eldar arrived, they found this continent of Machine-God worshipers far more difficult to raid than the upper continent. However, when they had exhausted those Imperial populations, they looked southward, eventually taking all that the Chaos Space Marines did not reach first.

3900364	Loyal servants of the Machine Spirit, I need not tell you that dark times are upon us. We are trapped here in Parmenie, and none of us may have long to live. As I hope to live to see our acquired precious machine knowledge transferred to Mars, I hope, with all my brethren, to escape this system. But if we should not, let us remember that it is a great honor to die fighting the powers of evil and Chaos.
3900365	From this time forward, all normal duties are indefinitely suspended. The entirety of our efforts will be devoted to erecting formidable defenses against our foes. These will include turrets and upgraded skull probes of all varieties, as well as automated sensor-basilisk arrays. Await instructions from your superior. Let us all ever labor for the glory of the Machine Spirit!
3900366	Rough, chilly hinterlands form the southern region of Parmenie. Where the northern province is settled thoroughly by the believers in the Machine Cult, this scrubland is largely desolate, but not entirely empty. 
3900367	Dotting the landscape are the outliers of Imperial occupation: military training grounds, industrial waste sites, silos, quarries, and the like. 
3900368	++ Vox journal, found in a burned out homestead ++
3900369	Don’t blame me for what I’ve done. I watched my wife and daughters die before me. It was death or embracing Chaos, and I knew that through Chaos, I might live. Live! It is life that matters and what I have learned is that Chaos IS life, for life is change and destruction and new forms, new mutations ever manifesting. We clung to the Emperor, a dying effigy, because He was all we knew. We feared life. We feared our own potential strength. The Imperium is dying. A slow death, but it’s dying. I did what I had to, that’s all. I opened my eyes and saw what fools all of us were, bowing to a half-dead failure slumped on a throne. Haha! The blasphemy still sends shivers down my spine. It is the freshness of life. I am given to Chaos now. Now I truly live!
3900370	The lone moon above Kaurava IV has long been a symbol to the planet’s inhabitants – of the rough-hewn beauty of their world, and its important connection to interplanetary travel. When the Dark Eldar arrived, the symbol took on a new and more horrible meaning. 
3900371	The Ancient Gate now served only its new masters, who seemed able to descend almost anywhere in the system through it. With the Imperial population on the moon quickly wiped out, the Dark Eldar quickly went on to control the one transit route from the moon to the main planet.

I write for myself, to sustain my courage and sanity.
3900375	The one who presides over this place has a great metal claw over one hand. His vile laughter haunts your dreams. When they captured our cadre, there were over forty of us: twenty-eight Fire Warriors and twelve Kroot. Day after day, he has taken one or another of us out for torture. Occasionally he will push one of us too far, but more often we die when he places our heads in a terrible machine. I have seen it. It is as if it sucked more than just the life out of you. I have seen their eyes grow vacant, murky, and something gleaming pass out. We have dwindled to only four. Oh! The pain – the agony. What horrible acts he has committed, I cannot repeat. No, not even here, which no one will ever read.

4900057	Soul Essence
4900058	Soul Essence is a spectral resource the Dark Eldar accrue by consuming the violet mist that remains when a living being has died.  Soul Essence is used to power the greatest abilities of the Dark Eldar.
4900059	Strip-mined until the region was scarred and largely uninhabitable, little of use remains here. A single valley promises safety and respite, but those who go there find only bloody strife.
4900060	The Cape is a narrow stretch of land between sharp rocks and a dire abyss. Any army trying to claim this central point will quickly discover how little room to maneuver they really have.
4900061	For centuries a mysterious people have defended these islands, depending on their attackers underestimating the tactical challenge. Don’t be fooled. Only the fast and resourceful will prevail.
4900062	The only land passage across the Morholt Range has seen its share of bitter combat – and then some. There is no room for hesitation here between towering mountain peaks.
4900063	Over the course of many Ork-Human wars, the burg of Bierhold has seen plenty of action. In fact, its broad streets have developed a bit of a taste for blood. Conflicts there always seem to take a messy turn for the worst…
4900064	Hill country means hill-top vistas and tortuous valley paths. Those hills roll straight to the edge of the Great Sea. Watch your footing!
4900065	Some seek the peaceful lands abutting the Shakun Sea for their health benefits, others simply to get away from life in the Kauravan megalopolis. When war comes to Shakun, there will be precious little health or relaxation to be found there.
4900066	This dense string of small to miniscule islands stretches out across a warm and peaceful sea. To bring them all under your dominion, be prepared to brave those deceptively clear waters.
4900067	While it may not be the dense urban jungle of Kaurav City or Dussala, don’t underestimate the winding streets and perilous crossings of Imperial Vyasastan. You never know what lurks beyond the next corner.
4900068	The frozen moon of Irridene is not a place you’d want to go if you had a choice. But as a trade route between planets, it is of utmost tactical importance. And that is why you find yourself braving freezing winds and brutal enemy fire, all to lay hold of an icy lump of rock.
4900069	This dense Imperial city, the size of an entire province, is a textbook case of gritty urban warfare at its worst. Take the canal district, for example. Taking and holding all six bridges has broken some of the galaxy’s finest generals.
4900070	The high-ridged enclaves that abound in this province have shielded its inhabitants from the planet's fierce and devastating windstorms. They also render the warfare a blind and vicious affair.
4900071	These desolate scrublands are often plagued by toxic water run-off from the more developed north. Your mobility won’t just be slowed by flooding. Sharp rocky promontories rise like gray knife-slashes between earth and sky.
4900072	Long industrial over-production has left the northern half of the continent in a run-down, polluted state. When resources are this plentiful, the fighting is guaranteed to be bitter and intense.
4900073	Most of this region is so treacherous that ground warfare is all but impossible. Use the winding paths, sharp ridges, and sudden gullies to your advantage, lest they be used for your defeat.
4900074	Once peaceful, verdant pastureland, the plains now fester with the taint of Chaos. Get yourself ready to descend into the corrupt and noxious lowlands to claim the prize of victory.
4900075	The Valan River is a vital artery, which descends from the Rokclaws and meanders across the Trivian countryside. Heavy forests and the river’s tributaries limit movement speed and visibility.
4900076	Once an idyllic paradise, Cerulea has become harried and battle-scarred. The many varieties of terrain that used to draw weary Guardsmen on leave are now just so many more challenges to the would-be conqueror.
4900077	A lone caldera is THE thing to fight for in this province. Whoever controls it has access to slag, and thus enough power, to defend the region indefinitely. Of course, taking and holding the point isn’t going to be easy.
4900078	The lowlands are composed of an intricate lattice of canals, which help to make this humid industrial wasteland a key interplanetary trade route. Unfortunately, they are a major hindrance in combat.
4900079	This is a land of fetid still-water pooling among rusty canyons, great natural resources, and vile seasonal rains. Fighting here won’t be pleasant, and winning won’t really be much better.
4900080	The Morholts stretch like a ridged and knobby spine across the great northern continent. Among those heights, the going can get rough. Don’t confuse reaching the peak with winning the war.

4900110	The Velvet Isles are paradise islands afloat Kaurava II’s desolate ocean. Sadly, they are simply too rich in resources ever to know peace or quiet. Controlling the land masses is critical to surviving these dangerous waters.
4900111	Once a fine Imperial city, ceaseless warfare has taken its toll on this location, which is pivotal to control of the entire city. The gentle spring of Kaurava I melts the snow, but instead of flowers, shells and corpses adorn the roadsides.
4900112	"Nonsense, there's plenty of room to reinforce here. I think this plateau goes out much fartheeeeeeeeeeeee…" -The late Lt. Peders.  Don’t make the same mistake as Lt. Peders. It’s a fine location for a stand-off, just don’t get too close to the edge.

4900115	"The only thing worse than the sand on Kaurava III is the 'water' if you would be so bold as to call it that. The stench of the stuff alone is enough to make ya head for higher ground.  I heard they built the relics on higher ground to get away from the stench of the ocean. It's nasty."  - Unknown Guardsman
4900116	
4900117	It was not meteors that pocked and scarred this moon. Those are the results of centuries of power struggle over what was once a vibrant and wealthy lunar colony. The battle rages to this day…
4900118	After countless victories, it was here on the smallest of battlefields that the great Frazier met his end.
