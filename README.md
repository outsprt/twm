# Titanium Wars Localization

This project contains localization files for the **Titanium Wars** mod for *Dawn of War: Soulstorm*. The goal is to provide a high‑quality Russian translation that respects the grimdark tone and established terminology of Warhammer 40,000. The guidelines in `Основа для readme.md.txt` emphasize keeping canonical names (e.g., Space Marine → «Космодесантник») and providing clear yet atmospheric descriptions.

## Installation
1. Backup your existing localization files.
2. Copy the `.cfg` files from this repository to your game’s `Locale` folder (e.g., `Dawn of War Soulstorm/Engine/Locale/`).
3. Launch the mod and verify that the Russian text displays correctly.

## Credits
* **Titanium Wars** mod by *GrOrc* and contributors.
* Russian localization maintained by *outsprt* and community translators.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome. Help us keep the lore intact while making the mod accessible to Russian-speaking players.
