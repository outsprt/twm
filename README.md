# Titanium Wars Localization

This project contains localization files for the **Titanium Wars** mod for *Dawn of War: Soulstorm*. The goal is to provide a high‑quality Russian translation that respects the grimdark tone and established terminology of Warhammer 40,000. The guidelines in `Основа для readme.md.txt` emphasize keeping canonical names (e.g., Space Marine → «Космодесантник») and providing clear yet atmospheric descriptions.

## Installation
1. Backup your existing localization files.
2. Copy the `.cfg` files from this repository to your game’s `Locale` folder (e.g., `Dawn of War Soulstorm/Engine/Locale/`).
3. Launch the mod and verify that the Russian text displays correctly.

## Credits
* **Titanium Wars** mod by *GrOrc* and contributors.
* Russian localization maintained by *outsprt* and community translators.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome. Help us keep the lore intact while making the mod accessible to Russian-speaking players.

## Localization Roadmap

To stay organized, track progress directly in this file. Mark each stage as complete and update the current stage as you work through the list.

1. **Encoding cleanup** – remove BOM and convert all `.cfg` files to UTF‑8. *(Done)*
2. **UI text review** – translate and verify strings in `DXP2.cfg` and `DXP2_VO.cfg`.
3. **Unit descriptions** – work through `AllGWUnits.cfg` and `AllGWUnits_SS.cfg`.
4. **Heroes and special cases** – translate entries in `Heroes.cfg`.
5. **Final proofreading** – check `W40k.cfg` and polish terminology across all files.
6. **Release and feedback** – package the translation and collect community comments.

Current stage: **Stage 2 – UI text review in progress**.
